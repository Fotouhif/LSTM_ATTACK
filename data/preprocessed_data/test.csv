1,Kitschy name cute concept a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains  Oink really had all the potential in the world nnThe space is simple open and clean although very sparse   what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of halfassedness to me Hey lets throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was disconcertingly completely blanknnThe service was super average better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious My breakfastloving SO and I did our usual each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes My omelet was nice steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies The home fries on the side though were cold The English muffin was barely toasted also cold and so slathered in butter it was slippery My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaiseslathered Benedict but lets face it hed slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable as was the OJ watery and bitter and coffee nnThe sucker punch was the bill with tip over 40 for two for breakfast If I wanted to shell out 40 for breakfast I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylors where I know the food will be spectacular and the service topnotch Alternatively I could go to IHOP across the street where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the pricennSorry Oink your prices make you little piggies Youve gotta step up your game because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience
2,I was at the restaurant several times and had a wonderful meal each time This review should not have been flagged
1,Let me start by saying if I could give this place zero stars I WOULDnI sent my husband to this walgreens being its the nearest 24 hr pharmacy to us BAD IDEA Its 930 pm we had left the hospital my 7month old has painful blisters in his mouth and is in need of his elixir medication shouldnt take more then 5 minutes to mix up and a diaper rash oitment My husband hands the pharmacy tech the Rx and tells her he will wait for the medications 1 hour and 40 mins later the medications are ready The tech is about to hand him the meds when he stumbles on verifying the address on file i usually pick up medications so he has no idea what address we had on file she looks at him weird and says hold on the pharmacist needs to speak to you keep in mind my son is at home crying at the top of his lungs waiting for his meds 10 mins pass and the pharmacist hands my husband the meds and says do you have any questions Either the tech had no idea what she was doing or was a real ahole pharmacist apologizes and tells the tech to ring him up She doesnt even look up or apologize NEVER AGAIN I will go out of my way and drive the extra 4 mi to the other 24hrs location
2,Super nice staff Helped us find a dinner reservation on a Friday night Nice wine selection Music is a tad loud but still had a great time
1,This is a terrible bar  TerriblennThey drove out all of the good staff due to the owners insane rants  They have a strange smell their pints arent they are in undersized glasses to look like pints  They are over priced and the food quality has seriously suffered in the last year  Save the trouble and go next door to san tan brewery
2,We have eaten at the restaurant several times as we enjoy the food and last night brought friends another couple as it was one of their birthdays  In the afternoon called and spoke with a hostess to tell her would like happy birthday written on the plate on whatever dessert was ordered  When we arrived at the restaurant ran in ahead and mentioned it to the hostess different than the one spoke with on the phone  When we did in fact order dessert there was no acknowledgement of a birthday with either a candle or writing on the plate  It was a very slow evening so no excuse about being busy but just that the messages were not relayed to the waiter who was very good by the way and not his fault  This was disappointing as we wanted to finish off the evening with that surprise  Called the manager this morning who apologized but absolutely no offer of a gift card for a dessert that could make this up to my friend  That was not good business
2,This place is awesome I absolutely love the close location to my home the people the food the prices are never a let down Great home style breakfast
1,Love their sushi but wow service can be slow and disorganized Ive gone 6 times average dinner time takes about 1 hr with 20 minutes of eating Sushi rolls come out one at a time and fairly slow See httpwwwyelpcombizsushikeetempehridhRO30ARaKzuPU9nuyvLnRgsrcself nI havent been back to Hon Machi since
2,My boyfriend and I have dined here twice We absolutely love it The first time we were with a vegetarian group his family is indian and the PUB was very accommodating We will defiantly be going back Their salads are just Meh But what else should I expect from a Pub I wont hold that against them since their french fries are sooo yummy 
2,It was my first time there both girls were very friendly and helpfulnfood was good but service ranks higher with me and they were great We will be returning
2,Good breakfast place in Cave Creek Just off the main drag Rustic western diner ambience with friendly staff We sat outside on the side porch with a view of Black Mountain Food is allAmerican diner Good portions Excellent pancakes Id become a regular at this place if I was a local
1,Im not sure where to start So Ill start at the end Disputed charges 18 phone calls refunded money and two months of life wasted All because they sold me a couch that was not made of the same material as the couch in the show room  Seriously the foam inside was different used and dirtynnTechnicians they send to your house dont even know what they are doing and they dont speak highly of their own company No and I mean no customer service at all They play games with you on the phone They use super nice statements and happy tones to try to calm you down before your even upset Then they state policies and try to get you off the phone ASAP I guess this is why the stores dont have direct phone numbers nnBottom line This company only cares about money and not you nnThis was the worst shopping and customer service experience of my life The products are no good Spend a few extra bux and go somewhere that sells quality When making large purchases customer service and peace of mind is worth every penny
1,My girlfriend took my mini Australian Shepard here today as this is where her doggie goes Im not sure what was going through their mind when they shaved her all the way down Seems to like there were lazy and didnt want to take the time to give her a proper groom Hair was unevenly cut Shes a long haired mini Australian Shepard Nobody wants this dog to look like a rat You will never have my business again Elite grooming on rainbow will continue to get my business as usual
2,I took a chance and drove to affordable flooring  more When I went in I was greeted by Travis  Alberto and the feeling I got was like being with family I knew I was going to buy from them no matter whatnI was right the price service  the quality of craftsmanship was excellence to none nI would recommend this company to anyone 5 starsnclayton
2,Popular steakhouse located off the strip  This place has an old school atmosphere to it  classy with dark wood decors and dimmed lights  I would definitely recommend making dinner reservations as they were completely booked for the night we were there  Even though we made reservations ahead of time we still had to wait 30 minutes before we were seated However we were entertained with live piano music during our wait which was enjoyable  nnOf course we did our research on yelp and ordered the crab cakes and calamari  The crab cakes were delish Ruth Chris use to be my fave for crab cakes but not anymore The cakes were packed with an ample amount of crabs that tasted sweet and delicate to the tongue I found the calamari to be mediocre nothing spectacular about it I probably wouldnt order it again next time I ordered the fillet mignon and my fiance ordered the rib eye  The fillet mignon was great but WOW their rib eye is scrumptious Aged to perfection providing the perfect taste when grilled to medium rare We also enjoyed their sauteed mushrooms I think it pairs well with steak nnI would highly recommend this place for anyone seeking a fulfilling steak dinner  You cant go wrong with this place
1,I honestly cant remember the last time I had worse experience at a restaurant  I have been known to forgive bad service when the food makes up for it but on this occassion that wasnt the case  The food was not the worst part of our dinner at RM but it didnt do much to overcome the offensively awful service nnTo begin with it was not clear when I made the reservation whether or not the upstairs more upscale part of the restaurant was open  I gathered from the website that it was not and we took our seats downstairs when we were seated  Our waiter told us once we were seated that it was open and suggested that we come back while we were in Las Vegas to eat up there  Well I will never be returning to RM in my life and I would never take a suggestion from that waiter  nnWhich brings me to my next pointnnOur waiter Daniel was a complete imbicile  It was almost as if he was in an entirely different place than us because he was so oblivious to what was going on at our table  To begin with service was very slow  It did take us a while to decide on our dinner but that didnt mean that we wanted to wait to be served our dinner once we ordered  Nor did it mean that we wanted to sit there with our empty appetizer and salad plates in front of us for the duration of our wait for our entrees either  The wine took an equally long time to arrive  nnDaniel was absent for much of the meal unless he was trying to upsell us on something and we often had to ask the food runners or other servers for extra plates and for bread  We were never offered bread and I noticed that other people had these wax paperlined baskets on their tables and I had to assume that bread was offered at this establishment and ask for it myself  That to me is a major transgression  Im glad we did not only because our wait for our entrees was so long but because the little biscuits in those baskets were really delicious  nnWhen our meal did arrive my surf and turf was all wrong  The turf was very rare and when I flagged Daniel over to tell him he wanted to take the entire plate away and I suggested that I could still eat my surf rather than have it sit under a heating lamp while the kitchen refired my filet  So Daniel brings me a bread plate to flop my entire half of a 2 pound lobster onto  When we flagged down another server to get me a bigger plate he looked at the lobster hanging off of my plate and seemed embarrassed  When I did get to dig into my lobster it tasted like it had in fact been sitting under a heat lamp for too longnnI told Daniel to forget the steak because we had a show to catch that we were nearly late for at this point  A few minutes later a young girl who was possibly a manager or maybe a mime came to the table with my steak and whispered some sort of apology but no one at our table could even hear what she said because she was so softspoken and timid  They brought me my steak anyway because they clearly sitll wanted to charge me 40 for it  All in all I ended up with an improperly cooked 80 meal that I had to eat as quickly as possiblennWhen I got my steak most of our table was done with their meals  Apparently the cobia and the scallops were good but there was so much going on at the table and we were so rushed that it didnt seem to matter  I had to try to scarf down my filet which is not my preferred manner of eating in order to get out of that horrible restaurant and make it to our show  As I was downing my steak and my fellow patrons were staring at their empty plates Daniel came by and asked  So far so good  What  What planet was this guy on and to whom was he speaking because clearly this was not the appropriate thing for him to say  Nor was it appropriate that he walked away from our table empty handed after we requested our check  nnBefore we dashed out to catch a cab my sisterinlaw and I visited the filthy ladies room while the guys paid the bill  They split the bill on their credit cards and Daniel true to form brought only one pen for both of them to find a spot on the cluttered table and fill in their overly generous ten percent tip
1,People who work there are full of attitudennFood is tastelessnnIce tea has no flavornnNo point to the place
1,Ok but they do not go out of their way to help I didnt have a credit card so at first they said I couldnt check in Finally they allowed me to put down cash Then I went to breakfast and the shuttle refused to pick us up because roads were too bad We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant No cabs could pick us up so I called the hotel and explained our situation had to get to work soon 5 mth pregnant woman with me only a mile and a half away He said he couldnt help We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces When we were almost there we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it driving in the opposite direction away from us I cannot believe how rude they were
1,Ordered two simple burgersnAn original with only lettuce mayonnaise and American cheese And a veggie burger with only lettuce mayonnaise tomatoes and cheesenWe got an original with tomatoes and onions and a veggie with onions and no cheese nEnded up being the driest and most terrible burger Ive had Should have asked for my money back go anywhere but here for a burger __
2,The best country fried steak ever Will definitely try to get back here when in Vegas again
