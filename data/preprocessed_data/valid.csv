2,Stopped here for lunch the other day after walking by dozens of times over the years  I had 2 slices of pepperoni lunch special  Pizza was hot and fresh and very good and tasty  Ive been to places where the lunchslices are sitting out for a while and are like wet cardboard but  not here  Will eat here anytime I have a chance
1,We had table and bottle service here so fortunately we didnt have to wait in line or deal with the BS crowd unless you unfortunately had to pee  Our waitress was nice as were the busboys that ran and got us two packs of smokes for those that were in need  nnHOWEVER people Im sorry but I just dont get it  The compulsion to hang out in a club playing a mix that has been in effect since spring break 1998 paying THOUSANDS of dollars just to have your own space so you can sit down for a minute before standing up and gyrating like a stripper again is crazy  Just CRAZY  nnI should note that perhaps I am just too old for this business but every time I struggled to squeeze my way to the bathroom and got groped by some guido looking for a well you know what he was looking for I questioned anyones desire to spend this much money to drink over priced booze and get molested  But hey I guess for some dropping 650 on a bottle of Vodka while getting pawed by some hag who is lip synching walk like an egyptian is a good time
1,My partner had to make reservation to eat at this joint and it took him three attempts It looks like a regular restaurant from the outside but it opens up as you go into the restaurant which was a little more pleasant nnIts very crowded and the servers continuously bump our chairs when they have plenty of space to walk around us Overrated and this food can be purchase at any Thai restaurant Not worth the hassle
1,First it is a sushi buffet so the servings are smaller than you get in a respectable true sushi restaurant  nnWhat I saw that summarizes this place  I noticed them taking vacuum packed labeled like retail sale fish out of a refrigeration unit and cutting them open  If you have ever gone to a true sushi place the sushi chefs spend lunchearly afternoon filleting fish doing the prep worknnIt does have a place and a function and I didnt see anything that would make people ill  but Meh fits
2,This was my second foodie fest so I knew what to expect  Unfortunately its always over priced But the food at most trucks is amazing and unique so its worth the extra few bucks  Come hungry and bring people you can share with so you can try more different options  This visit I tried Buldogis gourmet hot dogs tornado potato  get porked the main lobster lady and of course White castle  nnOne disappointment of this visit was the lack of a beer garden that they had at the last event  They still served beers but nothing on tap and only very limited bottle selections
2,I have been doing a lot of dropping off and picking up at Sky Harbor lately Ive been there about 6 times in the last 23 weeks And since our local police force always seems to chase me out of the terminal when my party is not there I end up at the cell phone lot They have lots of parking available and a big sign to tell you when the flights arrive In addition its easy ins and outs from the lot to the terminals
2,Harleys are one of lifes guilty pleasuresnnI have come here several times and have always found the employees to be both friendly and helpful  nnThis dealership also has a rental operation which I havent used but is suppose to be very easy to get in and outnnEnjoy
1,I consider myself a pretty patient person for the most part However that flew out the window in this situation I needed to get my car wash and I heard good things about this place so I decided to try it I pulled up and there was 3 choices to choose from and I wanted to know the difference between the works and the vip since there was a 6 difference in price The guy literally said  your dashboard is shiny I laughed and he said he was serious oookkkkkkk weird So then I said I really want my car vacuumed and trash cleaned out and asked which one I should get and that I was willing to pay extra he said the works is fine because as you can see on the sign it says vacuum RUDE nSo I got my car and it was shiny and smelled nice but there was still trash and it looked it they barely put a vacuum near it I kindly asked for them to vacuum and he took my car for 2 minutes and THERE WAS STILL TRASH and ughhh so annoying I got in my car and said see ya could of done this myself nnNever going back there again Never
1,So Chris and I arrived about 8pmish on a Saturday saw the line was crazy long really we had no idea where it ended So we left to go get a drink before standing in line by the time we got back 20 mins later it was under control and didnt seem to long We chatted with some folks ahead of us from San Francisco so it made the hourish wait go by fast When we finally got up to the front to pay one of the employees came and announced they were at full capacity and would stop letting people in at 10 and would pull food at 1030 nWe were next in line and figured mehh we waited all this time and we can eat in an hour Never again will I do that We felt rushed the whole time I barely got to eat with my husband because either I was eating and he was up in line or the other way aroundnNow to the food Its was OK it wasnt worth the 102 we paid When we came here in November they had KING crab and this time had crap snow crab I was very disappointed What I did like was the prime rib oh boy was is cooked perfectly it was succulent and moist and the lamb I tried the Thai tea gelato and loved it it tasted like the real thing However thats about it unfortunately We loved it so much the first time and we were so sadly disappointed this time I doubt well ever be back
2,Ive been here twice for lunch and its very good I love authentic Mexican food and this definitely hits the spot The price is good too I hope La Palapa sticks around because Southside was in need of a good authentic Mexican restaurant It finally has one
2,Was visiting Pitt a while back and everyone said Big Jims was the place to eat They couldnt have been more right Big Jims is a place you wouldnt even notice as a restaurant on the outside and I cant even recall any businesses surrounding it The food is where this place really shines  I settled on the Veal Parmesan and couldnt believe my eyes when it came to the table the veal was bigger than my platter  I couldnt even finish my meal and ended up taking half of it home great value for the money     They also make homemade wedding soup thats outta this world    We woulda dined at Big Jims our entire time in Pitt but Diners Drive Inns and Dives happened to be filming while we were there and we couldnt get near the place again bummer
1,I have had Cox Cable for 8 Years and had next to no problems until recently when I called to try and lower my bill doing research I found I could get cheaper TV going to them as a new customer and they treated me like a spoiled child for even asking what my options would be I was on hold for over 35 min on one failed attempt to talk to customer serves when I gave up DISH or Direct TV has better customer service and cheaper rates only reason I gave them 2 stars is the product it self was good for me and I still have there high speed internet I shut off cable and am using internet for TV now
2,I dont care what anyone says I had an amazing time here Although its not as big as the old gameworks on the strip there are still plenty of enjoyable games for any age limit Unfortunately the first game I played had a little problem and it wasnt working at all so I wanted to speak to a manager about it because I didnt receive the points I won The manager Charles was so polite and friendly My friend and I were complaining to him but he kept his calm and handled it so professionally He eventually refunded our points and had a tech to fix the game Its my favorite game so far nThe only reason why Im not giving this place a full 5 star is because some of the games werent working and it just opened
1,If I can do 0 stars I would This is the worst fertility practice Ive been too Especially the front desk not to point any fingers but TINA should NOT be working in a place like this I was suppose to start my treatment in July and was suppose to receive a call prior to that which was in March 2014 and guess what Its 82614 Znd I still havent received a phone call I have made several calls and TINA and the manager SHARON promise every single time to call me back and they never did I referred 3 patients here and after my experience I decided to let them know his terrible theyre Not to mention but they where very rude when I told them that Ive been trying to start my treatment and needed to see the dr They said he didnt have time to consult but will start the treatment next day What I mean Im paying you 15000 and I cant even have a word with the dr Please dont go here Im also in the medical field and this is so wrong everything about this practice seems very fishy
2,great products and services
1,I went here twice with my friends both turned out to be disaster Their siumai tasted so weird It like they cooked with ruber band or something Also their chicken feet tasted not so good compared to Phoenix Place in Chandler nI would not come back to this place again If you would like to try every best dimsum I would recommend Great Wall at 35th and Camelback in phoenix
1,Ive never been a huge fan of BJs restaurants They seem to offer all my favorite things beer and food but the place has never really grown on me nnOn this occasion I shared a half buffalo chicken and half sweet pig pizza I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza but they no longer serve them in the pan which was a disappointment Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasnt the same I didnt really enjoy either pizza flavor either Ive had both before and they were ok but this time I was completely underwhelmed The pizza just didnt seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either nnI did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea Im always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea The service was ok as well Our server was friendly but she wasnt very quick with the refills so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have likednnOverall its not my favorite restaurant chain but it does in a pinch I just havent found the menu item of my dreams here yet
1,I give this nail salon a 1 star only because I had to select something  If youre looking to get your eye brows done this is not the place to go  First the technician didnt ask what I wanted done she just began trying to clean my brows up rather than arching them which is what I wanted This irritated me seeing as I had already expressed to her to arch them and I expressed that I had not been able to find a good place since Ive been here in Arizona  She began saying she knew what I wanted however did not provide this service As I was paying to get my eye brows done she was trolling me she would see me when I came back after I clear expressed how unhappy I was SMH  I politely told her I would NEVER come back to this place of business
2,The place looks amazing inside Its the largest nail salon Ive ever seen for starters They do manicures at a bartype set up They have pedicure chairs with wash bowls that lite up wLED lights really pretty  I think they have nabbed all of the best nail technicians from around town because everyones nails looked fabulous and everyone seemed happy when they were leaving The ladies at the front desk didnt think twice about letting me run to get cash from the Chase bank across the street because I was without a debit card  u cant put the tip on a credit card which is all I had on me So my one and only negative remark is that u have to pay ur tips in cashthats the only negative I can come up with And I had an acrylic fill with gel polish and came to 45very reasonably priced place Oh  they have a spa right next door  what more could u ask for
2,Melissa is the best Ive been going to her sporadically for a year now for Brazilians she is very good at making you feel comfortable in that notsocomfortable situation She does very good work and is really informative and clearly knows her stuff nnRecently I had my eyebrows done by Melissa for the first time and I was so impressed Im a little bit crazy about my eyebrows they have to match have the right arch and so on she understood my craziness and talked to me about what she was doing and the end product was perfection Melissa is a pro and she is so fun and easy to talk to love her
