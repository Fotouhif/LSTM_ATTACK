1,First I pull up to the right window and they serve the left side instead even though I was first Then my person took forever taking my order that another 2 people went through on the other window when I was done ordering she said is that all and I said yes then nothing No confirmation screen no total no please pull forward She never came back so I just took off I was like hello  Did you get that  You there  McDonalds  quarter pounder  If you cant handle operating 2 drive thrus Stick to one until you get it figured out OR hire people with some kind of skill Its not that difficult to take an order now
2,Chicken Sharwarma is amazing  I get the chx sharwarma sand its in a pitaand hummus on the sidennVery cool small joint family run enough said  Very good food
2,I love this place I wish i could make it there more often Turkey club is my favorite 
1,Theres not enough meat in the pho u can get double the amount of meat in Chinatown LV Too much cinnamon and star anise in the broth Id much rather drive the distance to Chinatown to get my moneys worth They better change that or they wont be in business long
1,Probably the most bland Italian food in the University area Not impressed
1,Went here with two of my girlfriends bc they got their free vouchers I was starving and needed something to eat after drinking at the pool so I paid 30 for below mediacore food The food was dried and bland The only thing I can eat much of is their peeled shrimp and crab legs because I can squeeze some lemon on it to make it taste decent  Now I have to give them 4 stars on their dessert bar so they got something going for them Other than than not going back
1,When an event is crowded I take it as a sign of success but when its congested like this one was I see it as a sign of negligent management or worse greed The solution is as simple as selling a limited number of tickets ahead of time obviously the organizers are not interested in that instead they boast of attendances of 40 and 50 thousands for the event Thats just crazy  nnUnfortunately Charlotteans must be really starved for street festivals since they oblige year in and year out I dont know Id get if this was a free Rolling Stones concert or another once in a lifetime event  but for Greek folk dancing gyros and stuff nnSince its a community event rather than a purely commercial venture I gave it an extra star
1,This company is horrible and need to change their business name to Dishonest Tech Carpet Care They are nothing but scam artists  Honest is what they are not I got their couponad55 for carpet cleaning for 4 rooms plus hallway with customer satisfaction stated on their coupon ad  My carpet is still in really good shape since we dont wear shoes in our house But who would pass up a great deal to give their carpet some tlc  What a waste of my time and day  I dont wantlike to be judgmental but from the moment I greeted the guy at the door he already seemed shady  He wasnt even in uniformhe was wearing street clothes with his pants all sagging  From the start I showed him the coupon and told him I just wanted the 55 dealto avoid any up selling He said thats only to steam clean I told him thats fine As he went room to room he tried to bs me and told me that I needed to deep clean two of the rooms because theres some discoloration and if he only steam clean it wouldnt look goodeven after it dries He offered to deep clean all the rooms for 279 if I paid with cash I seriously LOL After I said No I only want what the coupon states He walked away and pretended to call his boss and told me he had lied to his boss that Im a regular customer and got permission to do it for 189  After seeing that Im still not interested he said hell do it for 149 At that point I wouldnt trust this guy in my house if he worked for free I told him No thanks And walked him out Twenty minutes later I got a call from his boss but told him I was busy and couldnt talk These guys have no shame nor integrity
2,Rarely do you find a spot that everything you eat is great  Will be going back soon for moreespecially the veggie board
2,i like keegans  its a small chain in phoenix  they also have one on camelback and another in queen creek  the food is quality for the most part  its american style with some original twists  the grilled chicken sandwich has a marinated cucumber on it and its such a nice touch and really makes the sandwich  also if you order a salad make sure you order the lime ginger vinaigrette dressing  its homemade delciousness  nnthe peach cobbler is to die for and so is the mudpie  nni used to work here years ago and the place is clean and the chefs know what theyre doing  so i may be biased to keegans
2,Great venue for music not a bad seat in the house We sat 90 degreas to the stage and it sounded great This has become my go to Phoenix Blues
1,to be fair this place is pretty nice with its convenient location and cutely decorated rooms nnHOWEVER theres a few major problems that ive hadn1 there was no room service at all only the trash was taken out on the first day and that was done upon request nn2 it gets very noisy because the house is not very soundproof Even the sound of someone walking in the hallway can be heard very clearly in our room nn3 the receptionist was very rude and unprofessional there was a mistake in our reservation so the check out date was somehow one day earlier than our plan The receptionist called us and basically told us that we had to move out in a very rude way claiming that there was absolutely no way we couldve made the reservation When we went to sort the situation out she said it had nothing to do with her and that the mistake was on our part When I told her that she was being extremely rude she crossed her arm and said sarcastically how do you want me to talk to you nnOverall very unpleasant would never stay again
1,Husband ordered calamari  tasted like the oil was very old   Watched waiter bring our food to table next to us and then take it back to kitchenthen they brought us both salads with OLD BROWN lettuce    Seriously that was a first for me  I have never been served spoiled lettuce at a restaurant     Hubby had salmon and said the flavor was good   I had stuffed pork loin special which was good with the exception of the side of pasta with pink disgusting sauce on it   What a disappointment
1,This is a PTs  Says nothing about PTs on the outside  On the inside it is all PTs  So you get that crappy PT food when you are expecting something different I felt swindled  nnI read somewhere that this is a high end PT  High end That is like saying Popeyes is a highend KFC  nnAnd the food is overpriced  nnNothing special
1,Downgrade and bewarenLadies and Gentlemen introducing Water Chestnuts as the new vegetable filler at this China One location nnThere were no less than 20 pieces of water chestnut filler in my usual Chicken wHot Garlic Sauce And the sudden absence of red bell pepper and only 3 or 4 pieces of green bell pepper in my dish Run away from this location This is the equivalent of You probably think I wont notice and next week you will add 20 pieces of Baby Corn and remove all nutritious and costly vegetable ingredients altogethernnFunny we decided to go back to the West Charleston location for the first time in a year because we happened to have some business to attend to in the vicinity Mistake Going back to the 921 S Rainbow location and never looking back The South Rainbow store has maintained the quality of ingredients that the China One brand is known fornnI hate when this stuff happens
2,Amazing food selection very quality too Good service Dont judge this book by its cover Building exterior was REALLY ugly when I was there
1,Ive never seen so many old shoes in all my life
2,Great Atmosphere Beer cart outside while we waited for our outdoor table by the fountain Live band playedit was Fridaythey have live bands on Friday and Saturday nightnnPizza was goodlots of varietybrick oven stylethin crustlike California Pizza Kitchen type Pasta was good We had the spinach and artichoke appetizer and it was good but more dippers were needednnCasuallet our party linger over drinks etc
2,Service and food were above and beyond what I expected This is now my favorite Lindo Michoacan location nnThe guacamole here is great They have a certain way of doing it but you can feel free to make a suggestion about certain ingredients to cater to your liking i let them do their thing and it never disappointsnnThe food was great we had a Chile Relleno Tamale combo The Chile Relleno was really good The pepper was cooked just right nice and tender but not mushy The stuffing in the Chile was delicious The Tamale was great a beef tamale and I could just sit there and eat that all nightnnWe also ordered a Gallo al Mojo de Ajo It was a chicken breast cooked in a garlic wine sauce I cut up that chicken tossed it in a flour tortilla with the rice beans and guacamole and I was happy Also ordered a Tamale with that I think that is going to be a permanent a la carte order from now onnnUp next was the Banderillas de Torro Grilled Beef skewers with onion and green red and yellow peppers A little tough on the meat but tons of flavor Good stuffnnService is half of the experience for me I can go somewhere with excellent food but if the service is lacking its ruined or I can go somewhere where the food is OK but as long as the service is great I will have a good experience This place is a no brainer if youre in the mood for good Mexican food and excellent service
2,Good burgers and EXCELLENT shakes
2,What an amazing amount of land It used to be a golf course Wow Has anyone thought about building a disc golf course on the property Its very cheap environmentally friendly and with that much area could be considered a championship style course if it was designed right
2,It was a nice change of peace  nnnWent out to have a nice dinner with the family  Turned out we will be coming back for Dim Sum  The dinner menu that they have is very flavorful and they do take walkins and around 530  6 pm they are not really packed for service  This is nice  You walk in a get a table and hot tea  Ok so service was on point from the start  The owner is walking around making sure that everything is to your liking  That is nice  Most restaurants you have to hunt down the Manager  The first course arrived  Pot stickers and crispy shrimp balls  Very tasty and the sauce that comes with both are a little different but still good  Then the main course comes out family style which are very nice when you want to try everything  We ordered the Rock Cod with Baby Bok Choy Curry Fried Rice with a fried egg and an eggroll Chicken with schezwan sauce needed more chicken and honey walnut shrimp  Needless to say all this for only 60 bucks is not a bad upscale Chinese food  nnOverall nnService  nice and friendlynFood  Flavorful and good portionsnQuality  Not to bad  decentnPrice  Average for upscale restaurantnn nThis is a formal restaurant with proper Chinese table service  nnWould I go Back     Yes
1,Extremely bland American Chinese food without much authentic fare  Entru00e9es lack flavor and are very oily  The fried wonton are a good snack or appetizer though  I would recommend driving out to Chandler over dining here though
1,I really needed a manipedi after my last work trip and this salon had really great reviews so I thought I would give it a shot I made an appointment and they were on time which was a nice surprise The nail tech was very sweet I think her name was Lisa and attentive and I had a nice relaxing timenThat said the manipedi itself was not the best Ive had I didnt feel like there were many extras that warranted the additional cost over most other salons  I mean 65 for a manipedi including my 10 new client discount is just a bit steep She pushed back my cuticles but didnt trim them and now they look awful Same thing with my toenails I also asked her to cut my toenails short but she only filed them which means Ill have to get another pedicure in about a week I need my nails really short as Im a runner I explained this to the tech Now not even 24 hours later my nails are chipping even my toenails which never chip Im just really disappointed that while it was a nice experience the service itself just didnt measure up especially given the price
1,I sent a photo order via website and it should have been ready in an hour I went an hour and a half later and they said they didnt get it They checked their computer in front of me and thy did get it but had not started it They were rude and encouraged me to cancel order I did but still get auto messages saying my order is ready I had  already sent it to another CVS and picked it up The other CVS I picked it up at did not have the envelopes that were supposed to come with the photo cards I ordered They sad Oh the website is out of date Well how am I supposed to know I was so aggravated that not only did I think the price I was paying INCLUDED envelopes but now I had to go and search for these odd sized envelopes on my own Ugh So DISAPPOINTED Online ordering is supposed to be a time and money saver Not in this case Ugh
2,We own a Timeshare and received a special offer to stay on the Strip We had a MiniFamily Reunion to go to and this place was perfect The rooms all had Kitchen and a spacious living area The Rooms had a balcony and our room had a Front side view of the Strip The rooms also come with a Sink Dishes Fridge Stove top and Microwave oven The place is also ideal for entertaining because they have a Dining room table and a couch you can chill out on Fitness Center 2 different Pools and Business Center with no charge is also appealing Plenty of Parking and it is Free The Kids Pool area is more like a lot of Fountains and Water spouts for little Toddlers and lil ones to play in The Pool on the roof is for everyone until a certain time It has a Jacuzzi and you can see the Vegas Strip Be warned we went up there around 5pm and there was a lot of Heavy Petting going on in the Pool Think of that scene in the Matrix Trilogy where you see the Orgy Party at Zion Other than that The Hotel is ideal for Family fun and convenience of the Strip Steps away from Gameworks and the M M store We will be back and definitely would stay again Timeshare owners just say no at the end of Tour and collect your free gifts
2,Been here twice for weekend lunch and was not at all disappointed  Both times service was awesome food was delicious and the place ran like a well oiled machine
2,I came here strictly based on the reviews I was a bit skeptical about any inspection station after recently being scammed in Los Angeles at Pep Boys Smog inspection by passing all my emissions which are way more strict than NV and then informing me that I didnt pass all checks due to my engine light coming on Thats funny because it was never on before I came here and my vehicle is like new Miraculously after I turned down their 139 evaluation to tell me what was wrong and hit me up with other made up costs the light went off after a day I found out Im not the first person to encounter this I feel bad for people who are not mechanically inclined and would believe this crap I know you can send false codes to your cars computer to illuminate the check engine After 30 plus miles your vehicles computer will refresh any false information Now you see my anxiety to bring my other car in Las Vegas that was never smog tested before with this recent chain of events Well thank you Yelp and the people who take the time to leave honest reviews This place was quick not like the 45 mins at the Pep Boy scam very friendly attendant and the passing grade I recommend this business just the same as the other 7 Yelp reviewers did Just be prepared if you go somewhere with bad reviews like I did at Pep Boys just because they were open late and close to my house Drive a little and feel confident
1,Came here to eat on a night out with 4 friends they messed up on 3 of our orders food was nasty and cold they took forever and we basically had to ask for them  to give us a discount which was 2 dollars off our bill wow never had such a bad experience at this Red Robin clearly change of management Never coming here again
1,I have to admit I was hoping for the best  especially since they have banana milk shakes which is all time family favorite  The decor is cute however the staff lags on cleaning up tables  Speaking of the staff the two guys were too busy slacking off while the cook was taking orders and making the meal  Oh and the banana milk shake tasted like tapioca pudding so clearly not real bananas nnWe ordered 2 Signature steak burgers which looked good but ended up more like Signature grease burgers on stale bread The meal comes up with shoe string fries that were greasy burnt and when I got to 12 way in the box were more like the crumbs of french cries of fries REALLYnnWe ate 12 our meal and pitched it not worth shitting on the potty the rest of the night  Yes that greasy nnI would suggest going to the chuck box down the street  But hey thanks for the wifi I posted this review with
1,Nasty Overrated Threw the crap out ASAPnPS As I was asking the server a question I could see her saliva fall onto my bagel One side of the bagel was overburnt for both pieces
2,The food was very good and I would suggest this restaurant I like food that doesnt taste as healthy and I have had better raw food like Pure Food and Wine in New York City For the price and taste I rate Aux Vivres a 4
2,My husband and I are getting to know Charlotte and its history one attraction at a time The Charlotte Museum of History was a nice way to spend an afternoonnnAdult tickets are 6 They have a tour of the Hezekiah Alexander Homesite which is the oldest surviving homesite in Mecklenburg Countyyoull learn this on the tour Make sure you sign up for the tour it is included in your admission ticket The tour lasts approximately 40 minutes and requires traveling a little bit of distance from the main museum building it is wheelchair accessible nnThe main museum building has exhibits that help educate guests about the CharlotteMecklenburg community artifacts that are being preserved and some further history of Charlotte and the Rock House historynnThe grounds are tranquil They have some picnic tables and benches along the little creek on the property I thought it would be nice to pack a lunch and sit outside to eat during a break from the museummaybe next time if I take my family members there nnIt was a nice way to spend an afternoon It only took a couple hours to go through and Im sure I could have sped up the process or have taken a bit longer to read through some of the exhibits For 6 per ticket it gives another good perspective on Charlotte
1,This shop has terrible customer service  Arrived at 620pm and was informed that they were closed it states on the website and on the door the store closes at 730pm Comical I would avoid go to a shop that respects their customers and holds consistent hours
2,First thing I have to say about MIC is that it is ADDICTING Addicting in the best way possible I guarantee you try one class and you will crave to come back The environment is friendly helpful and fun Dont worry if you are a beginner the teachers will help you throughout the whole class Ive been going to Alexs phenomenal flow class Every time I attend his class it makes my day so positive I cant get enough of his class The cafe inside the MIC is wonderful as well Plenty of healthy options after your workout Not to mention they give 10 off if you order your food before class starts
1,My review can be summed up by the letter I mailed to the ownernnPersonal names have been blacked out because Im not totally horriblennRE Bootzer male ChihuahuannDear Dr nnI have been a client of your location since I moved to Phoenix in 2004 Your facility has cared for two of my dogs Bootzer and Mattie However I will no longer be bringing my pets to Alta VistannThe reason for this letter is to inform you of my disappointment in your staff On numerous occasions I brought Bootzer in for a consistent honking cough Each time your staff would test him for something new such as Valley Fever or Kennel Cough and each time after paying around 300 for a specialized test we would be told our dog was healthy and just needed to shed a little weightnnOn our last visit we met with    examined Bootzer and did not perform any tests rather he suggested a prescription weight loss food and then tried to up sell us on flea baths and preventative deworming He had no explanations for Bootzers cough except that he was overweight and small dogs often breath in dust and it could be a response to thatnnOn July 13th my husband and I had to euthanize our beloved Bootzer due to his trachea collapsing The emergency hospital we took him to was extremely knowledgeable and knew right away what was causing his distress After speaking with the veterinarian we learned that collapsed trachea is a common problem with small dogs and Chihuahuas are a high risk for this problem and its not uncommon for this to be a hereditary issue We were also informed that the cough and his lack of being able to exercise should have been a significant sign to any experienced professional veterinarian This could have been treated earlier with medication a harness instead of a collar and putting a humidifier near his cratennAs you can expect my family is very saddened by the loss of our friend and frustrated that not only could this have been prevented but that we could have improved the quality of his life while he was with usnnI will be informing the public of my disappointment in Alta Vista via word of mouth and review sites like Kudzucom and Yelpcom I will also be contacting your receptionist to have Matties records transferred to a more reputable vetnnI dont know how much money we have invested in your clinic to date but Im confident that we spent too much  considering that the real issue was never diagnosed tested for or addressed I dont see you considering compensating us for our loss or the money we spent with your organization but I want to voice my displeasure in losing a family member due to a lack of caring negligence and incompetence
1,So so foodbut I liked the patio  Better food and cheaper can be had at Elmers or Filibertos
1,I used to work on State Street and would have loved to get a little bag of popcorn for my bus ride home but every time I went down to Clarys it was never open  didnt matter what time of day what day or the weather  Hours werent posted and sometimes the sign said open but there was a note saying be back in 5 minutesI would wait and eventually have to leave to get my bus  When we could get in I would rave to the owner about his popcorn and he was generally disinterestednnI finally moved my popcorn urge on down the road to Vics where theyre not only open for business but also give free samples
1,My room wasnt available even though I booked it 3 months  ahead of time They gave us a smoking room instead and if we wanted something else it would have been extra money per night When we got into the room it wasnt that clean the sheets had a couple stains on them there wasnt a refrigerator nor was there a microwave When I called and asked about it they gave me major attitude and snapped at me even though I made sure to be polite and nice when speaking regardless that I was upset The sink didnt drain and neither did the bath tub It seems like we got the last room available because it was on the far end of the hotel and was the very last one at the end of a really long smelly hallway Called house keeping for more towels and soap never received them nnFor two nights and three days it was only 124 which isnt too bad You get what you pay for I guess
2,Korean BBQ  Warning while attending and eating Korean BBQ please dress appropriately  After effects may include  full belly the need to use a toothpick flush face especially when youre Asian and YOU SMELL LIKE YOU JUST ATE SOME KOREAN BBQ commentsnnI should have known but I enjoy putting on a nice blazer  that now needs to go to the cleanersnnMoving on Korean BBQ is a small mompop shop  The name of the restaurant got to the point and no beating around the bushes here  You get what you order  Grill your beef strips and pork fat yourself  Hmm aint nothin like some pork fat over some Hite  OB beer  Soju doesnt hurt either but make sure you can handle yourself after a few rounds  Overall the food was pretty good and authentic here Service was lovely and our waitress started the grilling for me and showed me the tools and tricks Yes my friends Im not much of a cook even in front of a grillnnAs I said early Korean BBQ is a small shop with some basic decor  They have a full bar but I didnt take advantage of it since I was busy trying to grill haha They seem to have a karaoke room that was empty  Not sure if they have karaoke nights but let me know and Ill bust out my Bruno Mars impression  Enjoy
1,Perhaps I hated Marios because I am older than 22 or perhaps it is because I felt like a pin ball being shoved between dude after dude  It also could have been the Philly in me not being able to relax in a bar that has large stained glass windows dedicated to Pittsburgh Sports I felt like I was behind enemy lines  nnEither way the cheap beer was not enough to woo me into liking Marios  The music was too random to be ironic  I am not good at math but I do know that the ratio here of dudes to girls  sausage festnnWe had one beer here and it took all my might to not throw some bows
2,Chez Claudette is your typical Quebec diner For breakfast substitute egg and bacon by ham and beans For lunch try a delicious poutine with a homemade gravy or steamed hotdogs all dressed sauerkraut pickles et mustard nnThis places does it right in the details For their hotdogs the pickles are fresh and sweet For their poutine the fries are crispy their curds are fresh not refrigirated and the gravy is made from scratch and not from a powder mix its a creamy textured beef gravy with an obvious pepper seasoning It is very good nnIn terms of the restaurant its narrow Lshape ensures that youre having an intimate conservation with your friends and neighborhors You choose if you like that or not nnedit It seems like this place has gone downhill I seem to be the only one whos reviewed Claudette and experienced warm fries and I swear it was a sober poutine experience when i went and it was a good one
2,This place is fabulous who doesnt love chocolate  I went during happy hour which I highly recommend  They have a predinner and late night happy hour  I had 2 mojitos which were both good  I also had a Satisfaction Guaranteed which was one of the most delicious chocolate drinks Ive had  Its made of peanut and caramel liqueur and milk chocolate served in martini glass  It essentially tastes like youre drinking a Snickers bar  I also sampled the works chocolate pizza which was fabulous  I never tried breakfast or entrees but they all sounded delicious  Make this place a stop during your next trip to Vegas I know ill be back
2,Love this place and have for several years  No the habanero burger is not as hot as it was before the fraud network ooops I mean food network came around if you have only one day at this beautiful culinary excursion with 4 people start with 1 habanero burger as an app cut into 4 for a group  1 cup of posole as a mid entree sampler then the Carlsbad is your oyster for virgins get the enchantment platter the specials are always good too I wont go on and on about every thing I eat there 10 year non local veteran  Nice people great service great food strong drinks I have actually eaten lunch and dinner there without leavingnCarlsbad I love you
2,Oh My God nnI ordered the vegetarian arepas nSo fricken goodnThe bread was amazing So much flavor and awesome texture nAvocado fresh Black beans flavorful and cannot be straight from a can nnThe two sauces they give youUSE IT nnEvery time I go to Vegas this will my FIRST stop nScrew the buffets and everything else nThis is the place to be
1,Terrible rolls The Dragon was so so The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food Seriously it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible
1,Im done  Ive been here 3 times twice for my truck and once for my wifes Mustang  The vehicle is always dirty and they have to rewash it and end up throwing in discounted goodies to help make up for poor workmanshipnnToday after they had to wash my wifes car twice and waxed mine to make it right I got in the truck to find 11 empty water bottles 2 aluminum coke cans two Styrofoam cups and an assortment of napkins and trash on the floor we had just finished a road trip of sorts  I even have one of those intruck waste bins  It was still over flowing with trash  I thought maybe they just forgot the inside but NOPE  They did the inside of the windows  They vacuumed the seats and put the fragrance in  They even ArmorAlld the dash  How did they miss all of the trash in the trucknnDannys prices are dirt cheap  I wouldnt mind paying 500 to 1000 more if they could just do the job right the first time  I dont have all day to be their Quality Control Auditor and they certainly arent paying me to do it eithernnTAKE A HIKE DANNY  WE ARE DONE WITH YOUnnDoes anybody know of a good car wash place in North Phoenix  Scottsdale
2,First time here at Detroit Coney Grill Heres my reviewnnService 55 the staff is VERY friendly and accommodating everyone went out of their way to greet us and make us feel welcomed nnFood 45 my mom got the gyro and I got a coney no onion and we shared fries The hotdog really does have a great snap to it Fries are hand cut and fresh nnGreat neighborhood spot will come back again
2,This isnt the Petco I frequent but one day we were in the area and I did not want to forget the kittytap food and found Solid Gold Before Grain and Merricks cans to please him And a few chew bones for the doggers nnCheck out the clearance bins sometimes you find some crazy deals there specially on harnesses and leashes I got a 5off coupon on my receipt this visit for any cat food kibble so bonusnnThe staff at this location is pretty nice even when we observed one customer be uber rude to the girl helping us
1,Chips  Salsa were good  Fish tacos  unsure of the fish they used or if it was just old heavily breaded with too much mayo  Wish they had a sauteed option  Wont be going back Should have had a discussion with them since they are a new establishment but I needed to get back to work
2,Yumm I love this place I used to live in vegas for a short time and made this an every sunday event wmy familyGood assortment of dim sum and it is actually cheaper than most dim sum places if it still is erverytime I come back to visit my sis I always go here I recommend coming early though because they often have a line coming out the door but i really like it It sure is yummy The only thing that I thought was kind of bland was the rice porridge but I can excuse that for the prices lol
2,Baja Fresh is soooooooo gooddrunk and sober But its freakin excellent when youre wasted off your ass Honestly we ate here nonstop those burritos and tacos soak up that alcohol and gets you good and ready to enjoy the days events nnWe stayed in Tower ll and its super convenient to that sidecheap prices GOOD food different types of salsa Oh mi oh mynnChipotle chile pleaseBaja Fresh is where its at God I wish theyd come to Texas
1,STAY AWAY  The worse buffet I have ever been to in my entire life  I am NOT saying that lightly  I would rather eat from a garbage can before eating here again  Second it is the smallest buffet I have ever been to in my entire life outside of the Sizzler  The food is awful  You have enchiladas without meat they are called vegetable enchiladas  They taste of the food tastes like they use the cheapest ingredients  They rarely clear your plates from your table I think there is actually a bus boy that does this because I saw him come out once  The only thing good I liked about the entire buffet was the fried chicken and the pot stickersnnI would NEVER eat here againeven if it was for free
2,Ate here several times during my last vegas tripnTried several pizzas and all were good  Yes they make a pretty good thin crust pizza just make sure you ask for it well donenAlso tried the beef terderloin which was really good  The Mac N Cheese is OOOOOOOh so good and god know how fatteningnThe last dish tried was the organic chicken and pureed mash potatoes  This was the least favorite of the all  Chicken had a funny taste but couldnt identify it it wasnt the rosemary and the mash was a little too wet
1,got a room very cheap on priceline well much cheaper than other hotels Overall paid just a few dollars less than if Id gone directly through the hotel nncasino smells very heavily of smoke but it is an older casino so to be expected But definitely noticed the smoke it more than at the other casinos we visited nncheckin line on friday night at 1030pm was LONG and took about 25 minutes The lady taking care of us was not friendly but also not rudennBellman was prompt and friendlynnWas able to upgrade from the smoking tower to the next nicer tower nRoom was clean And upon checkout I was told the upgrade would be 10day 2 days but was only charged the resort fee of 15and changennParking was pretty awful Often Valet was full as was selfpark Once at the valet stand he said they were full but asked what room we were in He suggested we try self park again but if we couldnt find anything to come back to him and hed see what he could do This incident made me think of another yelp review Id read about a  customer being told that their car couldnt be valeted because they were in the cheap tower WHATnIt seems there was another parking garage WAAAAY at the back of the hotel property but there were no signs indicating so So the last night we were there we actually parked in the HILTON parking garage what a hasslennnThe times we did use valet they were promptnnWould do my best to try one of the other less than stellar hotels like casino royale or imperial palace before coming here again
2,I have been here many times and have always been satisfied  The sushi is amazing Of course I always get the same thing anywhere I go baked salmon roll but it is so good  The edamame is fantastic sauteed with garlic and served hot  MY FAVORITE PART IS THE GLUTEN FREE options they provide  Soy sauce has gluten in it and for me I choose not to eat gluten so them having this option helps me out tremendously  I do not think we have ever waited for a table not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing but I am happy we dont have to wait  you can chose to sit at the bar a table or a boothso nice to have those options  You are going to be paying the average price for the rolls nothing is over priced but it isnt super cheap I have never had an entree but my friends got the meal that included chicken tempura salad and a bowl of rice  It looked great and was priced just right for the amount of food they received nnThe waiters and waitresses have always been great I love this place and while writing this review my mouth is watering thinking about the edamame
1,Like one of the other customers said on her review the customer service here is terrible Unlike the workers of this place I will remain a lady and not cuss even though this place deserves to have that kind of foul language used to describe this salons horrible customer servicennI went on Valentines day 2142014 Sat for over and hour only to be told I would not be worked on because I wanted pink powder used with my white tips I explained that I had the original set done elsewhere and I had had a fill done there with pink powder before with no problem Didnt matter she told me to leave and have a Happy Valentines day nnBottom line want to be treated with respect go elsewhere
1,Errr I didnt like this burger experience so much nFirst  to say something good wow they have a big menu with lots of options nnOk nQuality of meat  was not a big thick juicy meaty thing It was like Burger King SadnOut of Hawaiian bun went with whole wheat Very generic Didnt have that yummy breadyyeasty flavorey thing that says Mmm someone must have baked this today Nothing special here nOne burger To go Thats all I ordered Took 45 minutes Jeeze nnIm comparing this to the phenomenal burger and amazing bun btw that I had at Neon Carrot in San Luis Obispo Top quality meat homemade ketchup you dont even know how good and pure real ketchup can taste until you have homemade like this After it is consumed you sit and just say to yourself Wow Im going to remember that forever nownnBottom line  this is just another lame burger joint Set your expectations there Nothing special Ive had special This is not it nnChek
2,I love piece box Have lived about 3mins up the road for 2 years  never popped in how gutted am I Lovely du00e9cor in this place somewhere you could sit  wind away a few hours with a good pal easily The menu is pretty extensive nice  creative but makes it hard to pick because it all looks so nice The cakes are all sitting out as well does not do good for the waistline But they are fantasticnPrices are pretty average 10 student discount which is good The food is worth the price due to quality  huge portions nOnly minor bad point is they dont serve breakfast items all day pancakes at any time of day is good please change this as everytime I am in I want to try them but I am always in too latenBad reviews on here count for nothing when you see people queuing up to come in on a sunday That says it all
1,At osme point it feels like every other chain organic eschewing mass supermarket in America until you get to the check out line and hear the ching ching ching  There it is kids gambling in the casino  As if you couldnt possibly get through your need diapers and donuts experience without gambling Food 4 Less Henderson is ready to help you continue your addiction  Who needs diapers Go spend the rent money on the slots  Your kids will thank you for it
1,This review is long overdue We stayed at the Hard Rock for my girls bachelorette party back in July Thinking about the wristbands to Rehab that come with staying at their hotel we all figured this place would be more than accommodating to our group of girls   nnUnfortunately they were the extreme opposite of that We reserved 2 joining suites however one wasnt ready and cleaned until the following morning after we checked in WTF  Can you imagine 10 girls in one suite overnightnnAs if that wasnt bad enough they freakin still charged us for that suite stating that they had offered us an available suite on a different floor Ok great but thats NOT what we reserved aholes  nnAnd then management tried to redeem themselves by offering us one more wristband to Rehab but what good is that when we already had enough for our group Of course we took that wristband anyway and sold it  P nnAnyhow to sum it all up the customer service was extremely poor at this property  Their front desk people didnt seem to know what they were doing  Management handled our room dilemma with zero consideration of our bachelorette party plans  The female manager insinuated that we were just trying to get out of paying for a one night stay  She was full of it not realizing we were ready and willing to drop some serious loot at their property  Big mistake nnIt was evident that they devalue their guests simply because their business flourishes for being Hard Rock a world renowned name  I plead with you all NEVER stay at the Hard Rock Hotel  Casino in Las Vegas  There are plenty of beautiful properties in Vegas with way higher and exceptional customer service  nn1 Star  for giving us a place to shower  get dolled up
2,If you enjoy fantastic BBQ done the right way then look no further than Little Miss BBQ My fiancu00e9 and I came in for lunch and were excited based on the previous Yelp reviews Everyone was right I ordered a two meat plate with the brisket and pork ribs The brisket had the most intense bark I have ever tasted It had a great smokey flavor with more juice than a man can handle The pork ribs are equally delightfulnnMy finance also ordered some pulled pork which was some divine swine The sides were equally on point with jalepeneo cheddar grits baked beans with tons of meat and potato salad lightly dressed to perfection If you want to try the sauce you will continue to be impressed All three offerings are delicious with the spicy being my favoritennI will be back and I hope the rest of you stay away for my own selfish brisket eating needs 5 stars with an emphatic yes yes yes
2,We have been here a couple of times and every single time it is amazing The food is hot fresh and always tastes delicious The service is great too Even if we come in close to closing they always have a smile on their face like they were waiting all day for us   We will keep coming back Amazing
1,If the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieris favorite breakfast dish his credibility has dropped a few points  I wanted to like it heck this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix but the pork chop didnt do it for me  It was dry and there just wasnt enough pesto to grab my attentionn nThe hash browns saved the meal for me though  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them very thinlysliced a little on the oily side and extremely crispy  I can eat this forevern nYes the place is small and the wait is long but I wont dock any points for that even though it was in 100 degree weather waiting is all part of the experience
1,We had high hopes as we headed out to Zappones for dinner We are big pizza aficionados We brought our son daughter in law and grand baby with us We both ordered the pizza margarita We were very disappointed I give them one star for using fresh buffalo mozzarella but other than that it was bland The sauce had not a lick of flavor The pizza was almost a liquid melted mess It had no flavor at all The crust was probably ok but without any flavor in the sauce it tasted like nothing Each pizza was 18 for cheese pizza I had hoped with all these 5 stars it would be like Pizza Bianco but alas it was not The waitress was very nice and the establishment was clean Thats about it Also we ordered the Caesar salad Again no real flavor at all Sorry Zappones We really wanted to like you
2,Best coffee place ever  Matt the owner remembers your name and your order and even remembers my dog  The amazing friendly staff does toonnThey have outside seating bike racks that often double as dog tieups with a water dish near by and one wall is a garage door so its perfect for warmer weather This is extra nice because they are also always packed with people
2,Very few things are more Vegas than Liberace Glitz glam excess and opulance Liberace was way ahead of his time I did not want to rate this place after my first trip Thats not usually the case for me but a true test of a museum is its return potential This place exceeds the expectations of return potential I have visited for work related things both times and I always seem to leave with more knowledge than I would expect As other Yelpers have said the museum is full of glitz and glam It has tons of artifacts costumes and cars enough even for those not familiar with the details about the man I knew very little before my visit and now I feel like I can communicate why Liberace was important to Vegas nIf you like Liberace Vegas history or just like to learn this place is for you nThe staff is very friendly and the cafe and gift shop are both very nice A must for the full Vegas experience
2,Dark wood dim lighting and Old Fashioneds all around We stopped in late on a Saturday to get our steak fix on and had a great meal here at Tornado Steak House My husband and I split the GIANT 28 oz on the bone Ribeye and let me tell you this thing is huge Loved the traditional iceberg wedge that came with the meal as well as the hash browns and giant onion ring on top of the steak but the steak itself was honestly a little lacking It just wasnt all that flavorful or tender which was a bit of a bummer Butour friends that live in Madison swear by this ribeyemaybe it was just the fact that we came in later in the evening and they just wanted to get people out of therewho knows The atmosphere was really cool and we still walked out completely stuffed so I cant be too upset When we return to Madison I would definitely give Tornado another go
2,I really like Tapacubo It has a nice atmosphere with a large bar in the middle comfortable booths around the walls a nice patio on one side and pool on the other part of the attached Graduate Tempe hotel nnI have been twice now and had the guacamole and chips both times The guac is delicious and they give an ample amount The chips are fine not great but who cares since the guacamole is so good The chicken street tacos are amazingly good In fact they would be perfect were it not for the very average corn tortillas that seem like you could buy in a grocery store nnThere is a small yet decent beer selection thankfully not just a bunch of Mexican beers When you get a beer on tap they are served in plastic cups  kind of weird but priced pretty well so who cares nnIf you dont want tacos tortas or a few appetizerlike shared plates this is not the place for you The menu is quite limited but that means the food they do offer is done well in this case Id recommend it  much better and unique than most hotel restaurants
1,I was hosting a baby shower and ordered food from Roberts Every time I called I felt rushed off the phone like they could care less if they had my business Customer service is poornSo I am setting up for the party and notice MOLD yes MOLD on the fruit and cheese platter Then I notice that I only have half my order of grape leaves I called them and Wendy walks into the party with a replacement platter By that time my guests knew there was an issue with the food How Embarrassing nI agree with a past post that they are a bit rude at times too nThey may be known for their cakes but I would steer clear from the cateringnNEVER AGAIN
1,For the clubnnConsnSmall venue  Sucky beats  Crowded  Sweaty shmelly bodies packed in like sardines  Grabbed by too many icky guys here This was around 1130pm on a saturday  Maybe its better earlier on a different nightnnPros  nNone really other then we got in for free with only a 15 minute waitnI heard that if you dine here you automatically get into the club with no cover or  wait  I think I would still pass though
2,I got to watch a movie at Regal Village Square 18 because they had an international movie screening here For an evening showing tickets were 11 nnThere were a fair amount of folks when we went but it was nice that the ticket line moved pretty quickly It was also nice that when we got inside that the  lines at the concession stands moved quickly too Pricewise the goodies at the concession stand were expensive Itnwas 550 for a medium soda and the soda was more full of ice than soda itselfnnThe overall movie theatre was nice and clean That is always a plusnThe theatre inside was neat and the bathrooms were fairly clean toonnI had a pretty good experience watching the movie here Big kudos to this place for always being a venue for foreign filmsnnI liked the location of this theatre It is in a nice big plaza where there are some nearby restaurants like Jollibee to eat at I also liked how at the outside of the theatre they have round tables were folks can sit down talk and eat
1,My family and i are so disappointed with this restaurant and we didnt even get to try the food  We were so excited for a new restaurant located near us that offer gluten free options Our son has celiac and is 3 years old Redthai advertises gluten free options and the phoenix new times has written great reviews in regards to the owner of this restaurant We went to eat here tonight Again our son is only 3 so he isnt going to eat spicy chicken pad Thai and or curry chicken etc we were told by two servers that the chef would not deviate from the menu We asked if the chefnWould make him grilled chicken and rice or grilled chicken and rice noodles The servers still said that they would not Make it for our son Are You kidding me What chef would not be accomodating to a child with allergies i guess we thought wrong about this new establishment What a bad impression My family and I are natives to central phoenix and we have been to many restaurants in the valley that are much more accommodating to our son and his needs and we have no reason to go back here Obviously  We got up and left this restaurant knowing that  we would never return
1,Disgusting Chinese food After the dirty diner let out that they had several major violations I knew I would never be back
1,I called this Dominos tonight and was treated so horribly by a female worker over the phone She hung up on me the first time while I was still talking and the second call she took my address and proceeded to tell me I was too far away when it was only 3 miles away She quickly told me another location and when I asked her if she could repeat herself she hung up on me again I will never order pizza from somewhere where Im treated so rudely
1,The atmosphere was a bit loud dual entry into the restaurant made for high traffic depending on where you were sitting for what ever reason there were 3 females at the host station most of the night dress code was not enforced silverware was spotty windows were dirty waiters customer service was nothing exceptional really nice view food was great and good presentation but they did however served what appeared to be Nutella Why would a restaurant bearing a Michelin Star serve a hazel nut chocolate spread that can be purchased at WalMart
1,I know it was like 4 in the morning but this place had a slow response time over drivethru speaker  including unexplained pauses  and ran out of rice for my friends chicken teriyaki bowl This means that Im going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell That place totally did have rice when I drove over there and it was way faster
1,Im trying to give it a 1 and a half but that do sent work so i gave it a 2 I found poo on the toilet seat a bloody piece of dental floss and a used coffee cup Good thing I brought my sleeping bag because i had to sleep on the floor because my sheets where discosting Some of the kids from my hockey team went to another hotel It Felt like I was in a cave in the woods it was so dark Only thing good was the lobby with the presentation room escalators view ice cream and great breakfast buffet and restaurant I was going to say the salt water pool was good but it turned my sisters hair GREEN
1,I had written a bad review about the this place not long ago and they were happy to give me another shot at eating at the place and paying for my meal Im glad they were willing to allow me to have another chance at itnHowever though it wasnt as bad as last time I ate here they food hasnt much improved I ordered the same meal the Buca Trio Platter I was a little hesitant to order the same thing that made me sick before but they were assuring me it was going to be goodnnI the mozzarella triangles arent bad for frozen food The stuffed mushrooms werent as wet as last time but this time my biggest issue was the calamari Last time I ate it it made me sick and had food poisoning This time around wasnt much better It didnt make me sick but half of it was cold and the other half was hot This tells me that they were cooked at different timesnnIm sorry to staff at Bucca but I still give it one star as the food was not good and the chefs must not care about the quality of their food
2,Awesome menu Very diverse I highly recommend the burgers
2,Always great pizza and wings  Best green olive pizza around  Wings are good and my wife loves the greek salad
2,Best bagels I have ever had First time I had it I was like WHAO nnBagels always made fresh The shop smells like heaven ought to smell This is a mustvisit whenever youre in the area
1,I came in here today to have my grinding brakes looked at My 2 stars are based solely on my customer service experience I didnt let them work on my carnnStrike 1 A mechanic came in and said Is that your Mustang  Yes  Thought so Ill tell the guys to stop making fun of it har harnRude unprofessional not cool to say to a customernnStrike 2 Presenting me with the repair bill and no explanation of anything just a lot of This is the EMERGENCY BARE MINIMUM  I did not appreciate being handed a 570 bill for just the front brakes and calipers with no explanation whatsoever and a lot of high pressure I just need the okay to get started despite me repeating a few times that I needed to check out my financial situation first nnStrike 3 Upon  telling the manager I would be taking the car elsewhere to get a second opinion he launched into what I consider a tantrum SECOND OPINION Second opinion I gave you the cheapest price around You wont get better Grumble grumble mumble  Took off to the back without another word I then had to wait a good 10 minutes for a mechanic to pull my car around guess customer service drops off a cliff when the customer decides they might want to check other options outnnI took the car to Sun Devil Auto who actually explained what was wrong with the brakes told me I did NOT need new calipers and that there was another more minor problem causing the wear on my brake pads They didnt use high pressure sales they didnt try to scare me with  words like emergency and the staff was all extremely nice
2,Had the Banana Split with vanilla and my boyfriend had the banana split with blueberry I tasted the blueberry and its delicious My vanilla was good too but I wished I would have just gotten a bowl of JUST blueberry Creamy smooth and so yummy nnThe building is a little offsetting with bums hanging around and bars on the windows but if you can look past that to go up to the window and order its totally worth it
1,If you like your hairdont go
1,Dont expect good customer service unless your a mild age white person or look like you just got off the course Not once was I asked if I needed any help _
1,Chompies based on my three visits is very unfriendly to children and Im speaking of wellbehaved 11 year olds not crying babies
2,We went there for the Community Liver Alliances Steel Chef Challenge The banquet space is large and nicely decorated It has huge windows overlooking the point which were nice They are also equipped with a decent sound system and projector system
1,This shop sucks Bought a 3500 lighter within one hour realized it was broken tried to exchange it and they refused telling me I had a attitude problem
1,How to begin this review  Im at a lossnnMy expectations of these national chains of family restaurants must be too high because I am consistently disappointed with them  Joes Crab Shack is no exceptionnnMy grandson picks Joes every year for his birthday dinner  I think its partly because he walks out of there every year with a handful of plastic sharks and partly because of the playground  Whatever the reason he loves the place and because of that JCS gets 2 stars instead of one nnThe service is mediocre at best the food is edible but flavorless and the decor looks like its all been picked out from yard sales  On this occasion we waited more than 45 minutes for our food for a party of 7 thats an excessive amount of time  One side salad had croutons two others did not even though they were identical salads  My daughter in law ordered her meal with the sauce on the side but it came drenched in the gooey liquid  When the waitress was told all we got was a sorry  The entree should have been removed from the bill  I had the Crispy Jumbo Shrimp and they were anything but crispy or jumbo  They tasted soggy and bland  fortunately the cocktail sauce served with them completely muted the flavorless dish  We also ordered the smores dessert which was pretty tastynnBottom line highly overpriced marginal quality food and substandard service  Go somewhere else  youll be glad that you did
1,I went there before a concert with reservations for a party of 6  The waitress was frazzled but kept getting everyone else worked up as well  It took over an hour for the first 2 out of the 6 beers to arrive  When the food came almost 90 minutes after ordering the orders were all wrong and it was cold  We asked for a manger several times from our waitress as well as other staff  Our request was in a respectful demeanor and we didnt talk down to anyone  The manager never came  I also wrote a note through the website several weeks ago this was the night Pearl Jam was in town and they never responded  Its one thing to have a bad night with a sub par waitress but its clearly not an off night when the manager hides from a circumstance like this and wont respond
1,BEWARE GET A SECOND OPINION Made appointment with there franchise 1800 number and was told appointment would be like 68 for new patient cleaning exam and exray When i got there i confirmed with receptionist that it would be 68 not sure if this is exact amount but Ill use it as an example Was told I had 10 cavities and needed a deep cleaning Then when i went to pay the receptionist tried to tell me the visit was like 85 She corrected it when i told her that wasnt what i was quoted 2 months later i go to a different dentist highly recommended by my coworkers He has been a dentist for 30 years He tells me i have ONLY 1 cavity not 10 and did not need a deep cleaning at all Please please please save yourself TIME AND MONEY and get a second opinion
1,42 for 3 shots of absolut Not including the tip Are you kidding me
1,Hmmmm  Not bad if you get a really good rate Like 40  60 Clean has the basics  Close to the zoo Free WiFi and continental breakfast However the room we stayed in had a really small bathroom and no dressing area  The pool was clean and well kept and the staff was really nice and friendly
2,Finally getting around to reviewing this little fast foody joint that is fast becoming a regular lunch spot for me  Good Asian near West Summerlin appears to be a rare commodity and this modern Hawaiian being a close facsimile to Japanese comfort food in a way LL is most welcome  I have been here 3 times now and I have not had a bad dish yet  Everything thus far is more than adequate and deserving of more than the 35 stars it averages on YelpnnI have had the chicken katsu fried shrimp and hamburger steak plates  They come with rice and pasta salad on the side  The katsu is crispy and wellcooked although the meat is a bit thin so they have to be careful not to overfry  They do a good job  The shrimp is appropriately battered not too much or too little and perfectly crispy  The hamburger steak is the real winner however  What looks like a couple of regular hamburger patties come full of that Japanese Hamburger Steak flavor drenched in gravy and all satisfaction  If you are not familiar with the flavor of Japanese Hamburger steak its very distinct from the taste of American burger patties  Not sure whats in it probably nothing good but boy does it taste good  Bentoss next to Mitsuwa in Costa Mesa is a great example  The only thing missing here at LL is a side of kimchi but this isnt a Korean place sonnThe service is on the pleasant side although I wouldnt say its goldstar material  You do have to wait a bit for your food 510 min and while there are plenty of seats it fills up quickly  This will be my regular spot for lunch and looking forward to trying a number of other items including the ramen burger and some of their Hawaiian dishes
1,Went in for an oil change and free car wash and was not impressed nnThe gentleman that helped me with my oil change was quiet difficult to hear in the noisy car bay and he was constantly trying to up sell me on EVERYTHING Not to mention when I asked how much an oil change is he said 35 for oil change and car wash I said okay then he asked what type of oil I wanted Now granted Im not a mechanic and I know my car has high mileage but I didnt know if he was asking for a brand regular or syntheticI had to pry options out of him Very quiet options mind you I asked for high mileage and without notifying me it actually wasnt 35its 55 Im not an unreasonable person I know it probably costs morebut at least tell me the new price Then again maybe he did and I just couldnt hear him nnEmployee what kind of car wash do you wantnMe well what kind do you have nEmployee theres a poster on the outside of the car bay over therennEmployee what kind of air freshener do you want nMe again  Well what kind do you have nAnnoying Give your customers options before they have to coax them out of you nnTo top it off theres a charge for my bottomofthelinecarwash weighing in at 3 Really So my 35 oil change and wash became a 55 oil change and 3 car wash with taxcosting me 60 Ill change my oil myself next time
2,Best buffet food Ive had to date Le Village Buffet offers a wide variety of French inspired dishes that are freshly cooked with very little in cost over the average resort buffet They had everything from fresh crab legs to a vegetarian bar which although I am not a vegetarian had a great selection The prime rib was five star for a buffet style restaurant nnThe minor reasons I gave this buffet a 4 and not a 5 was for the following reasons There was a severe lack of claw crackers or tiny forks for the crab legsclaws which just seems sadistic given the freshness of the meat They appeared to be seating nondiamond customers in a separate room alway from the actual buffet I dont have a problem with preferred customers getting faster seats or discounts I just felt like I was in some sort of containment camp for poor people And the sushi was just average if your going to serve sushi serve it right The rolls were boring cucumber  california and I couldnt find a small cup or dish for soy sauce which means I would just have to pour it over the rolls and that is just wrongnnAll in all that is a great buffet for the money and really spices up the standard buffet selection Last but not least save room for desert The desert section is more impressive than some restaurants have only time Ive ever done seconds on a buffet dessert table
2,HUGE portionnGet ready to get stuffed nMake sure to NOT order too muchlol
1,Boycott Sprouts They are attempting to take over lands in Albany California which are part of a public land trust for agriculture The land is currently being used by urban farmers to feed the poor Look for this film soon in your area wwwoccupythefarmfilmcom to learn more and visit the websitenhttpwwwboycottsproutscomabout1cj86
2,good gym newer equipment they have a movie theater room where they play movies everyday  sometimes it smells a little sweaty in that room but its nice to have you get into the movie and then you keep running more
2,Like Macy M I had tried numerous massage therapists before discovering and staying with Ismail for over two years now  He has helped me to heal injuries and prevent new ones with his therapeutic massages that target my vulnerable and sore areas   He has the skills and knowledge to combine techniques to suit each clients needs which is invaluable and very beneficial for his clients nnIsmail is extremely professional respectful and reliable  I have family who make sue they can schedule massages with him when they are here from a neighboring State  They havent found anyone as skilled  near their home and tell me the effects of his massages last a month  I now see Ismail on a regular schedule and consider it a vital part of my self care and injury prevention  Highly highly recommended
2,Loved our dining experience at Fellinis They even had a whole gluten free menu consisting of pastas sauces etc boy have i missed alfredo sauce my boyfriend and i both shared the smoked salmon appetizer delish a piece of chilled smoked salmon dressed with capers oil vinegar with a side of smokey cream cheese for my entree i had a shrimp alfredo with gluten free pasta it was so amazing Steve our server was phonom too i will def make my way to the stratosphere just for this restaurant
1,If I didnt love my kid so much this place would not be an option Im afraid I might have contracted hepatitis from this place First off its a Saturday night Is it possible to schedule more than 1 person Waited 15 minutes before anyone came to the counter to take an order for the 20 some people in line Drink station had more garbage on it than the garbage cans No ice on either side Tried to ask an employee but there were none Waited 35 minutes for our pizza Went to the counter and asked how much longer and this girl rolled her eyes and brought out the wrong pizza She put it on the counter and walked away Just walked away Asked LUV the manager about the wrong order and he ordered us another pizza which I never received I was robbed One bright spot almost all the games were working
2,Friend suggested we head to Barrio Cafe for Happy Hourand we did just that We ordered a few items off of the Happy Hour menu and enjoyed a few drinks We pretty much had the dining room area to ourselves Tasty No complications just a great time Barrio Cafe never disappoints For all those that have had bad experiences here I hope I never go to BC with youId hate for you to jinx my meal Cheers
1,Way to fail Wendys nnI saw a commercial for baked sweet potatoes last night and decided to swing by Wendys for lunch today to get one I was also picking up another one for my coworker two chicken ceaser wraps and a salad nnI went at 1130 just before the standard lunch time Wendys only had one sweet potato available The lady taking my order thought I said I wanted chicken ceaser sandwiches I corrected her but I still ended up with the sandwiches instead of the wraps in my bag Glad I checked the bag before driving off
1,Oh Ruths Chris  You were so good at the Yelp Elite event when you first opened at the Harrahs  What happened nnAt the request of my mom she was my plus one at the Elite event and was very impressed we celebrated my brothers birthday at Ruths Chris a couple of weeks ago  Please be forewarned that there is no valet or self parking anywhere near Ruths Chris  Its at the exact opposite of all the entrances if you are arriving by car  nnThe one star is for the decoration of the restaurant but that was it  From the bread the 400 degree hot plate of bonein ribeye to our servers unkempt attire it was not the upscale experience food or service Ruths Chris is supposed to be  nnBy no mean am I trying to be a snob about the whole affair  I think I am capable of adjusting my standards based on where I am at  However for the price and the service Id take my dollar right next door to the Caesars Palace Joes Stonecrab and be a happier customer
2,I love fake boobs and I love rich old dudes and I REALLY LOVE out of control Scottsdaleness so the Fox Sports Grill is pretty much like Disneyland for me nnGo for the cougars stay for the Sunday Bloody Mary Bar Good times for allnnIm not being sarcastic
2,Well I guess I lucked out and came on a good night It was pretty busy at 6 pm on a Friday night which means that people like it enough to go there early I thoroughly enjoyed my buildyourown chicken burger on which I got a ton of the veggies It kind of fell apart since there were too many veggies so I would recommend just choosing a couple My husband really liked his byo hamburger too It wasnt too greasy but now we understand why it is called Smashburger They literally smashed his burger to a pulp so it fell apart very easily Got the smash fries which had a lot of olive oil on the top but not the bottom Our chocolate malt was good but we got it about 10 minutes late since the runner girl gave ours to a different couple who came in after us Boo And when you deliver our food and I tell you that we are still waiting for our malt and you take 10 minutes to bring it out to me that is not acceptable  I expect it to be made ASAP since you already should have had it to me 10 minutes earlier But that is just me being picky I guess
2,Tolles Restaurant und sehr sehr leckeres Buffet Von der B10 aus gut einzusehen parkt man am besten auf dem Parkplatz vom Fressnapf mit dem Aufzug ins OG und man betritt dieses schu00f6ne Restaurant In edlem Holz eingerichtet mit Teich in der Mitte und schu00f6nem chinesischem AmbientenDas Buffet umfasst alles was des Herz begehrt von vorgekochten Speisen bis hin zu Suppen Eis etc Man kann sich auch die frischen Zutaten aussuchen und mit Sou00dfe kombineren und alles frisch vom Koch zubereiten lassen Das PreisLeistungsverhu00e4ltnis ist absolut ok die Bedienungen sind sehr nett nFazit Empfehlenswert 
1,Ill never be back Arizona is bad enough enough on its own right but this place and its fd up car rental system takes the cake
1,I dont know what changed in a year and half but the quality went down rather drastically This used to be my one and only favorite destination in Madison for a while but theyre so out for me nownnMy friend and I stopped over here on Wednesday bar hopping night and everything was terrible nnFirst the service Ok but nothing special And what happened to those smoking hot ladies Why is a jersey wearing lady with zero enthusiasm serving us Is this Weds night thing If so Ill never come back And the terrible drinks too My mojito was passable while my friends caipirinha was way below the standard If they have the balls to charge 68 on a drink I expect something good  nnIve seen this trend in Madison If you used to be the it place you need to keep up with the incoming competition and continue polishing the reputation rather than taking it easy by falling back on the title
1,I really wanted to like this place but it just didnt make the cut nnFirst off where do we eat Too many patrons not enough tables Second the wait for the food was probably about 2030 minutes Kitchen seemed to be a bit unorganized as I noticed like 10 or so tickets at the window Now for the important part the lobster We ordered an original lobster roll lobster mac and lobster grilled cheese Unfortunately we werent really impressed The lobster roll was inconsistent in flavor Some bites were pretty good others were eh It was also pretty small should not be called large The lobster mac was sad to say Bland and runny Couldnt really taste the lobster and it looked like Mac and cheese but the flavor of the cheese was almost nonexistent Definitely would like it to be more creamy and rich Finally the lobster grilled cheese was actually the best of the three but was far from phenomenal The grilled bread was good but was mushy It didnt have that crisp you expect from a grilled sammy I told my girl the best part of my meal was my beer nnI read an earlier post about this place It stated if you dont like your money eat here I wanted to find out for myself but about 40 poorer I definitely should have taken that yelpers advice Dont say we didnt warn you
2,Went to meet up with some family on the East side of town this weekend I told them I had some diet restrictions and they suggested Pita Jungle which I was stoked on as I love me some PJ I didnt know they had expanded that far east nnIt was a Friday night and the place was hopping We were seated pretty quickly and our waiter was on point all night nnThe food came out a tad slow but it was all great and everyone enjoyed their meals
1,I would hate to complain if I felt like we simply ordered poorly but this experience struck out in every way nnThe waitstaff took entirely too long to address our table when many other tables around us were being seated and served We ordered three dishes steamed vegetables vegetable lo mein and kung pao beef and tea All three dishes were seriously not good to the point that we left them on the table untouched How do you ruin lo mein I had to prompt the server twice to bring our tea and we never got refills on our water We had to finally ask another server to bring our check because our server was nowhere to be foundnnWe will not be back 
1,I am here 46 times a year  I have to say in the last hand full of visits there has been a problem with my rental  I am a gold member and this last rental they have a new system that sends you a text to tell you where to find your car so you dont even have to check the board sounds great right  Well they sent me two texts for two different cars  nnI went to the most recent texted car and while it was an okay rental it did not have the little extras that the other car did so as has become the drill I went into the office and waited in line to see if I could switch carssure I go get the the other car change over my luggage and drive offonly to find that the AC is not working as well as one would hope for an Arizona rental during a hot spellnnThe return is always easy although when I mentioned the AC issue I got a song and dance from the guyyou would have thought it was his job to sell me the car not listen to the issue and make note so it could be checkednnI am not sure what the problem is but I having thought about it after a week long rental I think this is not unusual for Hertz of lateWhile I still think they are better than the rest I think they are sliding down a slippery slope when it comest to Customer Service and Product
1,I received two calls from the driver telling me he is on his way AFTER the time he was supposed to arrive so I continued to wait for him as the clock ticked on then the driver calls to tell me Im here but when I looked out the window no one was there Turns out he went to the west street rather than where I was located which was the north street Didnt matter because he called to tell me this 21 minutes past the time he was supposed to arrive so I would have missed my plane anyway Which is exactly what ended up happening nVery very frustrating
2,Place is very clean I dont know why this stood out but it did I got the Barby slider was a tasty little burger I could see myself stopping in from time to time
1,Ive visited this place with my child twice  First time was okay Wait was long  but Dr Lisa Miller was nice and explained everything to us Second visit Not so much Wait was still long  but its expected nSecond doctor  didnt get HIS name Was condescending and he just looked overall annoyed that he has to be there They told me that my sons Tylenol dosage is 75 ml while my regular pediatrician and the Tylenol bottle says that his weight is 5 ml only  So I asked him why it was conflicting He proceeded to write down mathematics formulas on a piece of paper while saying it out loud sarcastically of why hes correct and the other info is wrong nThen after he left without explaining anything to me about my childs illness  I asked the nurse if I can ask him a couple more questions He comes back in with an annoyed look on his face and told me to hurry because he has eleven patients and he doesnt have time  Wow assh nSeriously  the idea of this clinic is awesome  But really  Get more sympathetic doctors Not McDouches
1,Heres the Fox business modelnn1Cease distribution of coupons for several monthsn2Post flyer inside offering something closer to a reasonable price than a special dealn3Deny customers the price on the window saying Oh thats only if you have a couponnnSo I can confirm its definitely not worth the prices they normally charge Specialties cost as much as what you can get at a place like Barros or Old Chicagobut not half as good All that aside Ill go to a place that actually charges the prices they advertise
1,we started from no clean tables available the only one clean had no chairs the cashier was so distracted we payed him 7 for the special 2 pizza slices  beer with a 20 bill he gave me back 8 when i asked him what was this he didnt even know what was that change from after reminding him he asked me how much is 20 minus 7 i said 13 then he grabs a pack of bills from his pocket and gives me the correct change i was never explained that the special came with only cheese pizza i asked to have pepperoni he mentioned if i pay 1 he will change it for me after getting my slices one is pepperoni the other one is cheese after paying 1 I asked him what happened and he goes ill give you your 1 back and keep the slices the worst place in downtown the pizza was ok i wouldnt come back
2,This location is a perfect spot to get work done nn1 There is a lot of space n2 Its not too loud where you cant concentrate on work n3 The staff is extremely friendly n4 Bombcom drinksnnCurrently I am obsessed with their Iced chai latte It reminds me of Christmasbut in the summer time Sounds crazy but Sambalatte has me returning every morning for the past weeknI order this with almond milk and 2 shotsso its actually an extra dirty almond chai latte nnOpera cake is also amazing Not too sweet and just enough to satiate that chocolate craving
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFULnnLet me preface by saying I have eaten at both Grand Lux Cafes and I will NEVER go to this one again This is purely based on servicennMy friend and I went there around 8pm on a Monday night Not busy at all We were seated right away Then we waited 10 minutes for our waiter He came didnt introduce himself is that a Vegas thing Ive realized not that many people do that and took our drink orders My friend ordered a Sprite and I ordered a berry fizznnYes I realize that it does not take the same amount of time to make a berry fizz as it is to order a Sprite However I wasnt expecting the waiter to bring out my friends Sprite and then 5 minutes later have my berry fizz come up at the counter and then watch my berry fizz sit at the counter for a good 15 minutes before he picked it up and brought it to my table I would have asked him earlier but he was too consumed watching Sportscenter highlightsnnI wasnt eating but my friend ordered the pot roast He said it was oknnOur waiter never checked in on us during our meal and finally brought us the bill after forever We learned then that his name was Scott So Scott if youre reading this me and the table next to us thought you were fucking awfulnnIn the future I will go to the Venetian and deal with the drunks there before ever going back to the one at the Palazzo ever again
2,The restaurant is located in up and coming Griffintown which is quickly becoming gentrified a hospital is being built a few blocks over  I made a reservation a few weeks in advance which I would recommend as its a busy spot  The menu is on a chalkboard so we had our server explain most of it to us  We both had oysters to start and then the steak with red wine sauce potatoes and greens  The meal was simply delicious I cant remember having a steak that good  Service could have been better but the food made up for it  I would definitely go back
2,Nothing but straight cleanliness professionalism and actual ARTISTS at this tattoo shop  The vibe to this brand new shop is very inviting and comforting to all I personally get tattooed by 2 of the 7 artists here  but because of the quality of work and overall talent that the other artists have I would be down to be tattooed by any of them  If your looking for amazing prices and talent  all you gotta do is walk thru the doors
1,Theres something about Biblos that was telling me do not come here You wont really like it I should really listen to my intuitionnnNow its not awful per se Its big theres lots of seats there are drinks and cocktails really not worth it though the staff are friendly the crowd is alrightnnBut its just so soulless You know that cut scene in Chicago where Catherine Zeta Jones character sings a song about Class and how no one has it any more Its all sellouts and cheap frocks and cheaper drinks Thats what Biblos is lacking Class Call me a snob or a fussy drinker I am I like my margartia to have proper salt on the rim of a proper glass and not to be watered down with too much tapwater ice I like my caipirinha to have plenty of lime properly battered at the bottom of the glass with just the right amount of brown sugar and nice cachaca Not a mixture of what tasted like offrum and more tap waternnOk so I drink cocktails and the cocktails here arent good If you were looking for a beer a gt and a place to sit its ok But Ive also tried the food here and it was quite uninspiring Not awful hence not 1 star But very bland and standard pub fare Basically for the price youre paying u00a38  u00a310 for a main youd be better going to a million other bars or restaurants or cafu00e9s that do food at exactly the same price or cheaper at far better quality If it was u00a33 for the chicken breast I had then its evidently at least good value But I was paying the same I would pay at one of my favourite bars for a handmade burger thick sweet potato wedges on a soft sourdough bun It doesnt add upnnIts really central and was right round the corner from our NYE venue so it made do And I wasnt disappointed I just didnt feel anything for it at all really
2,We had to wait in line for about 10 mins before being seated as it was very crowded on a Tuesday afternoon nnThe menu is fairly small but its a burger place The onion rings are really good and I liked them better than the regular fries which were a little thick for my tastes nnThe burger was amazing I had to add one of the chipotle ketchups to my burger which added to the flavor The buns are amazing soft and freshnnThe pricing is reasonable for this area Our waiter was really nice too Ill add this to my list of must eat places every time I come back to Vegas
1,Sadly this was the WORST dining experience OF MY LIFEnnMy fiance and I were staying at the Luxor and decided to go here for dinner While the place looked nice pretty decor I did note while there that the place was never full Now I know why nnWent in was seated then asked the waitress about her recommendations I decided on what I wanted and told her so and then she just said Ok and walked off Didnt take my fiances order either We were too shocked to immediately respond So we called the manager who was aimlessly wandering around as were a number of staff  they had 12 people at least walking around the floor which was less than the number of tables occupied She said she would handle it then ANOTHER waiter came over introduced himself and took our order saying he would look after usnnWe waited for our food and then a DIFFERENT lady gave it to us Strange I noticed that the couple of across from us paid and were complaining to our first waitress saying that their food was cold and they werent happy And another couple next to us asked how come they didnt get menus when they sat down nnOur original waitress came back to check on us but didnt communicate where shed been the whole time Very confusing nnSo I then told the hostess who was also walking past and said the service was substandard and confusing and that the first waitress didnt properly take our orders The original waitress came back and rather than just saying it was a miscommunication which I would have accepted accused me of not talking loudly enough for her to hear Number one rule in customer service  dont be aggressive and accuse the customer Argh nnThey explained that the way they work is unique and you dont have one person as your waiter and we just didnt understand them Do I have to understand this cant I just get my foodnnIn the end we got a discount which the manager gritted her teeth about we had to fight for it she wasnt going to give one initially she charged us the whole bill Then as we were leaving the original waitress Katrina said to us I hope you trip on the way out If you cant serve customers properly and take feedback then you may as well fire yourselfnnTotally sucky experience Pity as the food was actually okay
2,Stopped in and got a 12 dozen Was a little worried about the other reviews but  ohhhhhhh man they were all so yummy  Cake was fresh chocolate carrot lemon vanilla red velvet and the icing was perfect  My new fav craving I Cant pick a favorite Decisions Decisions
2,Excellent burger in the high end of the scale nnWas a bit skeptical to the whole Gordon Ramsay put his name on this place thing and thought that maybe the whole hype is more beause of the name then the actual food nnWas happy to see i was totally wrong Ok so part of the hype is because of GR himself but the quality and taste of the food is great anyway nnWe started of with the jalepeno shooters wich was 6 awesome cheesebacon filled jalepeno poppers with lots of punch Great start not to be missed nnThe pork belly pig bao buns wich was a kind of a slider in a pita looking bread was not as good It was way too much carrots and the bread was doughy and way to thick The pork belly was tender but that was about everything that was good with this starter Sorry Gordon  nnAnd for the finally i took the Hells Kitchen burget with some kind of cheese avocado jalepeno and oven roasted tomatoes Medium grilled and it was perfect when it came out Ordered a side of mayo since there where no sauce on the burger but the burger with condiments was so juicy and tasty i left all the mayo  nnIm a true burger nerd that love to test both chain and upscale burger with fois gras and truffle but this is one of my top 3 burgers i have ever had  The price I think it was about 15  wich is less then a mediocre burger at Hard Rock Cafu00e9 or similar place where i come from I think its a bargain even though its a little bit more then the usual burger chain
2,Mona is fantastic  Her readings are very accurate  She combines this with helpful guidance as to what is going on and practical suggestions on how to best take the next steps  She is also generous with her time  I highly recommend her
1,My husband went to Haidyn last week because our complex posted a 20 off special First of all the regular price was 30 He was charged 25 20 off shouldve been 24 No biggie in itself  When he got home we noticed it was uneven on the sides and all over the back He called to ask her to fix it She did but charged him 15 This is the first time I have heard of a stylist charging to fix her own mistake We would not recommend this salon
1,This place looked good from outside and walking in left i was transported to Jalisco and with the Ambience felt I was about to enjoy an authentic meal but quite the contrary Service was the worst and food completely sucked Absolutely no flavor I could have made better chilaquiles and better Barbacoa nnOnly one guy working and it was the worst service waited 20 minutes for coffee and the place wasnt busy nnIts a great concept and feels and looks like one will enjoy a great meal but false advertisement nnYouve been warned
1,Ah Robertos Your location is of no relevance Eastern Bermuda or anywhere else for that matter I can always trust you to give me the bubble guts I think Ill leave it at that nnOh thanks for the free limes for my Coronas tho
1,Their curried vegetables are pretty bland  I would definitely recommend Husnus right next door over Kabul for any vegans  The vegan food is tastier there and you can always eat the soup or salad that comes with your meal The salad dressing at Kabul has eggs in it and when I went they didnt have a vegan soup  The service at Kabul was good though
2,Good stuffnBe prepared to try every single flavor in there  You cant just go in and order Try as many as you like  until you feel the server is fed up with you The girl behind the counter was patient as she scooped out little samplers of about 8 flavors between my friend and me Had to try the blue cheese flavor  Actually pretty good but when I was thinking about how I was eating blue cheese I couldnt bring myself to ordering an entire serving of it   Ended up ordering  the mint chocolate chip which was amazing  The REAL taste of mint was refreshing The perfect amount of dark chocolate pieces  I also ordered the salted caramel since everyone raved over it  Didnt taste any hints of salt at all Very rich and creamy but nothing special about it  I think the best part of my experience at SR was the marshmallow they torched and put on top of my dessert  The marshmallow was to die forget the marshmallow Did I mention that theyre homemade Toasty goodness
1,I am only giving this place 2 stars because our first experience here was very good The food was pricey but still excellent and the server was attentive and friendly Based on this experience we decided to return What a differencennThe first time we sat in a half booth which was quite comfortable this time we sat in a full booth which was very uncomfortable I am fairly short 54 and found the post supporting the table to be in the way of my legs you can imagine how my 63 husband felt The seats were very plump and the table felt too low for them As a previous reviewer wrote without exaggeration the menus are excessively heavy We placed our orders my husband got the waffle with eggs and sausage and I got the steel cut oatmeal The food did seem to take awhile to come out but I cant accurately say how long since neither one of us was paying attention to the time The server said he would return with the sides for my oatmeal brown sugar honey raisins walnuts Well this never happened and in the time being not only did I notice the oatmeal was room temperature it had developed a skin on it from sitting out too long I sent it back and received another bowl of oatmeal in much the same condition I will only send an item back to the kitchen once if it is returned still subpar I will cancel the order which is what I did My husbands meal was also at room temperature and undercooked for his tastes but he elected to not send his back Instead he felt he overpaid for a very mediocre mealnnWhat was most surprising to me was that the manager never visited our table I have never sent back an order much less cancelled it and not had the manager come by to apologize I am not looking for freebies but find that it shows that they care about and are on top of things at the restaurant they manage  This place is more expensive than the far superior Grand Cafe at Sunset Station which is better situated for those who dont want to walk through a stinky casino to eat
1,Your website says good for kids  Stopped by for lunch on Saturday with wife and young son  Server quickly met us at door to advise it is a 21  older establishment  We left disappointed and wont be back  Perhaps you should update your website so you dont waste peoples time
2,This is the best sushi place Ive found in Henderson so far The quality is good and service are good The rolls are fantastic but there are so many rolls on the sushi menu that I cant keep track of the ones i havehavent had or the ones I like They may want to skinny down the sushi menu just a little to cut down on confusion but I do enjoy the adventure Perhaps a few daily special rolls would be cool
2,Saw the Groupon for Lebanese food and thought wed check it out  We had the lamb kabobs falafel and a salad  Everything tasted very good and the portions were huge  Me and my friend couldnt get enough of the pickled beets  The service was friendly a couple of people came out to see how we were enjoying our meal  I would definitely stop by again
1,This place sucks  You have to pay for drinks  What kind of lounge is that  Oh how I miss Delta or AA or United lounges  The service at the bar was kind of rude as well but I let it slide cause I was a thirsty dude with a family in tow  But mind youUS AIr sucks and this only shows even more why this airline all together is terrible  No wonder they will allow any one with AMEX to come in regardless if they are flying on their airline  You have to pay for everything
1,I had such high hopes for this placennFirstly its too small for Fri and Sat night crowds It was literally elbow to elbow in there It looked like they have some sort of balcony area above the bar  If that wouldve been open it wouldve been 10 times more bearablennWe stopped in this past Friday night and man were the douches out in force W in the 1st 5 minutes after getting drinks my friends boyfriend was rammed into and had his beer spilled all over him and watched as a couple whod moved their stools away from one of the tables proceeded to say Were using that table to anyone who tried to just lean against it I got the impression from the clientele that they were just there to try whatever brew had the highest alcohol content rather than try different new beers but thats what a location on Mill brings I guess Its still disappointing for those of us that like craft beer for craft beer not for how wasted we can get in one sittingnnTo say that their beer list is overwhelming is an understatement I kinda felt like there shouldve been a companion to their beer book which was listed by type of beer that was listed by country like at certain karaoke bars by artist song title I realize that their fridges are set up by country but we could barely squeeze in at the bar to order let alone peruse the cases on either side of the tapsnnUnlike Kate K not one server stopped to ask if we needed anything However once we got past the 2 girls that were just hanging out at the bar taking up space Cuz this is where the scene is the bartender was quick to take and get us our ordernnId like to go back here during happy hour on a weekday or maybe right when they open on a Sat to give it another shot because I really want this place to be awesome
2,I lived in Naples Italy this takes me right back there Awesome I had the Margherita Pizza first bite brought back memories
1,Horrible customer service at this location The older women at the registers get flustered easliy and pawn you off on another employee to ring you up Is rather drive out of my way to a  Joanns it a Hobby Lobby than to ever set foot in this store again
1,Im giving these guys a second star only because I really enjoyed my visit and the staff is friendly After reading the reviews I figured the place was on the up and up So I gave them a call nnI was assured my insurance was accepted and they were a preferred provider This was not the case After the xrays were taken the doctor suggested a full scaling as I hadnt see a dentist for a while I figured I was already there so why not The receptionist came in to tell me my insurance required a 50 deductible and I wouldnt be billed anything else Maybe it was the friendly atmosphere Or the fact I was already numbed up but I didnt put two and two together that my insurance only charges that deductible for nonpreffered providers So they were in network but they were not preferred as I was told they were The office stuck to their word and didnt bill me for the extra my insurance didnt pay almost three grand  But the prices they charged my insurance company used up my whole years allotment for ONE visit A cleaning What if I had an emergency Or needed a tooth capped I cringed at the thought of that bill nnDo yourself and your wallet a favor and use the list your insurance says is in a preferred provider They agree the accept a lower billing from the dentist in turn charging you lessnIf this is on your list of preferred providers your in for a treat as this is a great office
1,I purposely made a yelp account so I could rag on this particular restaurant and how frustrating they are I hope the owner sees this nNotice two stars and not just one I love their food They get an extra star for that The chips salsa is the bomb Enough complimentsnBut the service is terrible If I could curse up a storm about them I would They deliver only on occasions it seems like They close up early its a college town What college town delivery restaurant closes up shop early  We asked for delivery at 830 and they said We close at 9 Well its not 9 yet wtf nThe service sucks Its so bad Im no longer going to order from this place again After they denied our money We drove to the one on Horne and Broadway which was still open placed an order to go and the guy couldnt make a salad We asked for just a dinner salad with no cheese or dressing And somehow they were incapable of doing that They took sooo much time asking how to make the salad that every time I gave them clear specific instructions they would come back with something like chicken on there A regular salad With lettuce tomatoes onions Did you hear me say Chicken The sad part to this is that they left a menu for delivery Anyway you should join me in boycotting Morenos Its a horrible experience every time
1,Very poor quality  food tasted reheated and old  When they first opened it was TOP Notch considering no one spoke English  but they were generous  thankful for our patronage   Once they obtained there liquor license all went down  hill  Its appears to be reheated  reheated over and over again  and maybe even recycled dishes from leftovers   Idk  but nothing tastes fresh anymore
2,I order delivery a lot from herenThey keep up to their freakishly fast delivery because I live so close nSandwiches are always greatnI cannot think of any orders they have messed up or forgotten anything
2,This is one of the best somewhat hidden gems in Las Vegas  Word seems to be getting out about this place as they have recently expanded  You will still find mostly locals in this offstrip establishment  They have excellent red and white sangria and tapas  But the best part about this place is the atmosphere  It does not feel like Vegas  This restaurant could easily be in an urban setting such as SF or NYC or even beach side in Southern California  It definitely has that appeal  I would highly suggest this place for just a relaxing place to hang out grab a drink and some tapas  Reservations are highly suggested
1,I got the Chicken Curry  It tasted like Hormel canned chili Not impressed The menu stated the curry was made with yogurt though it has a tomato base It was served with quarter sliced pita bread curry is usually served with naan flat breadnnSaw three couples sit down and walk out while I dined Guessing the price was a shock nnThis is just another famously named restaurant with average food overly priced that tourists end up paying for  touristtrap
1,Mr Tofu was closed for electrical issues and my family had already parkedso plan B we walked over here  Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded a glass of water was knocked over  The waiterstood there and didnt offer assistance no towel or additional napkins  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy we asked for chopsticks  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over  At one point we asked for additional napkins and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves  Excuse me What did they hire you for This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place  nnOnto the food the banchan consists of kim chee pickled cucumbers and radishes bean sprounts mashed potato and broccoli  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version Ive ever seen  Ive had food court Korean with better banchan selection  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before  However this place obliterated my craving probably forever  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy  The beef broth tasted like MSG waterit was altogether a horrible dish  The galbi was overly sweet and didnt have a nice char on the outside  The bimbimbap was just average  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didnt have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr Tofutheres a reason why people pick this place as plan B  Although Mr Tofu has a much more limited menu the prices for basic items like tofu soup noodles bimbimbap are probably 5 less over at Mr Tofu   For me this place will be plan Zie I probably will never eat here again
1,Overpriced mediocre food Overpriced underpoured drinks Terrible service The only thing this place has going for it is atmosphere  Frankly I dont understand why this place is so jampacked with people  Trendiness I guess I am pretty sure we will not be not be going backnnThe saving grace for this place came near the end As we were finishing for the evening the bar manager came by and he was very friendly I explained the irritation I had with the fact that their burgers do not come with cheese and that the waitress did not suggest cheese options   This was a mild irritation made worse by the fact that when I asked the waitress about it earlier she had said Its in the menu which of course if I had seen that I would have ordered appropriately  nnWell anyhow without expecting it requesting it or even actually wanting it the bar manager did comp my burger So for that I guess we will be back at least once  But we gotta get there during happy hour cause the drink prices are halfoff thennnUPDATE 82213 As you can see from the comment from Leah below it is this level of leadership commitment that will bring us back to the restaurant for another go  I will post a brand new review once we do and update this one if our experience is better
1,So I had an irrigation problem and since Im not particularly experienced I called up Jim and he came out and gave me a quote  I should have called around for other quotes but decided to go ahead and try him out  He came out the next day about three hours late which wasnt a big deal because I was at work and fixed the multiple issues I had  nnAbout 2 weeks later I awoke and looked out in the backyard and it was flooded with three inches of water  I called Jim in a panic and he managed to calm me down and told me hed be out the next day  He showed up took a look at the problem and advised me that the valve was missing a rubber seal  I was a little peeved because this was one of the valves they had worked on when I had called him out the first time  He replaced it and proceeded to tell me how he was doing me a favor by only charging me 5000 for the part and wasnt charging me for labornnI was so angry at that point that I just gave him his money and he left  nnSummary  Prices seemed a little high not a particularly friendly character but he did come out fairly quickly when called  I will probably use a different company in the future
1,Im not writing this review because of one bad experience  I live less than a mile away  I have been coming here since they opened and in the past I felt this place was a well deserved 3 stars  My how times have changed  The past 45 times I have been here the service has just been awful  We came with a friend 2 weeks ago and she was appalled at how she was consistently ignored  only because she asked for water to start and then she wasnt followed up on the rest of the night  The food is decent the beer prices are high but the service is 0 stars  On our last and final trip here we came in and sat down waiting 1015 minutes with no acknowledgement  I finally got ready to order from the bar when a waitress that had passed us several times comes by and says this table is taken you will have to move they are outside smoking  No apology no nothingjust get up  The table was empty and there was no indication anyone had been sitting there I told her we had been sitting there 1015 minutes waiting to order and she just walked away not caring  Had this been a one time thing u could understand but the service is so bad that I will not return  Too bad this place isnt close to what it used to be
1,We have been to this particular Yolies in the past  This place has gone extremely down hill since the last time we were there  The service was horrible they didnt even have a cocktail waitress so the elderly female owner took orders and she screwed most of them up  The sides to the main dinner were also horrible  The vegetables were served cold and were served 15 minutes before the meat showed up  The salad dressing tasted like pure vinegar I couldnt eat it  The meat was fairgood  They had one server for about 70 people 2 tables of 18 walked out  My only regret was we didnt leave with them  What should have been a 2 hour dining experience turned into a 4 hour one  Time for the owners to retire and sell this place because the doors wont be open for very long  There are so many good restaurants in Vegas dont waste your time or money on this restaurant  Oh yeah and another thing the guy serving the meat spilled blood from the beef plate all over 2 people at our table  They didnt even offer to clean their shirts  An awful experience to say the least
1,Delicious Smoothies but why one sizennnMy beef with this smooth criminal is that there is only one size smoothie to order and that size is HUGENORMOUS  I have never finished a smoothie from here and when they are frozen they get icy and lose their appeal  Offering a smaller size would be an easy thing to do and I imagine more profitable as wellnnThe drivethrough line is usually very slow here as well since the food takes a few minutes to assemble  nnThe food is ok the smoothies are fantastic just too big  nnCome on I know us Americans are big but cant we get a little less lovin sometimes Tropical Smoothie Cafe
2,We came here for the Sunday Champagne Brunch and it was fantastic There was a huge selection of great food and our awesome server kept the mimosas coming even faster than I could drink them as soon as my glass was halfempty hed bring out another nnAbsolutely unbeatable value But pencil in a siesta for later
2,First found this place while looking for a spot to eat after visiting the bar on the second level we had a spiky haired dude named Jason who seemed to know more about drinks than anyone we ever met we asked him to just make us up something good After a couple questions he made us some amazing drinks and we never made it to dinner we spent the night enjoying some drinks and joking around with Jason If your in town and want to have a good time go see Jason at Chandelier
1,Until tonight this was my favorite local sports bar to go to The service has always been great the food very good the location for me is good they have a ton of TVs and they even have an outdoor area and allow dogs nnBut management can make really bad decisions that will result in losing customers for goodnnTonight was a big game according to the fans who packed the place Phoenix their HOME TEAM mind you is in the NHL conference playoff series And the game is on virtually every TV and the volume is up An environment to be expected in a sports barnnHalfway through the game they started playing bingo BINGO Calling out numbers on the microphone over the game People including my party of 5 and we hadnt ordered dinner yet started paying their tabs and leavingnnI was appalled that a sports bar whose HOME PRO TEAM IS IN THE PLAYOFFS AND HAS A PACKED HOUSE think its okay to suddenly let BINGO override the game Let me interject here and say that I USED TO BE A MANAGER OF A SPORTS BAR IN LAS VEGAS THE OWNER WOULD HAVE FIRED ME or the patrons would have raised hell FOR ALLOWING BINGO TO INTERRUPT AND DOMINATE A PRO PLAYOFF GAMEESPECIALLY IF OUR HOME TEAM IS IN IT So after leaving I called and asked for the general manager His name was Michael I asked himWHY  nnHis answer We have bingo every Thursday so thats what I went with CLICK Thats right he hung up on mennMichael you are LUCKY that as PISSED as I was that Im giving you TWO stars Its because out of fairness the food service and ambience are great YOU as a manager deserve negative 10 stars for choosing bingo over hockey playoffs and for hanging up on a guest whose party was ready to spend close to 200 Get a clue dude
2,Why eat here when theres a Cheesecake Factory a few steps away Thats exactly why Step out of your shell my little BananaRepublicCrateandBarrel shopper Theres a whole new world of individuality out therennEven though this joint is part of Fox Restaurant Concepts megaconglomerate it is a unique place to try Ive been a few times on visits to Scottsdale and each time I leave with a smile on my face Good California style cuisine according to their signage that pleases this CaliforniannnMahi tacos yum Trout Delish Their servers So this is where the male models work when they arent in a photo shoot
1,The Original in CA seemed much much better  It is a mecca of craziness on a weekend but still seemed to deliver more than the Scottsdale one  nThis location appears to be too Scottsdaleized  overpriced slow on service and lower on quality than in CAnThe staff was extremely slow one poor guy was at the front to handle coffeepastry orders make them and then handle the register for everyone in the store  not his fault but not what you expect for the prices you are paying in there  nThe meals were not delivered the way we ordered them  Yes we ordered a sandwich to split and requested two platessettings When having to request that a second time we were looked at like we asked something ridiculous and then it took awhile to get  nThe tritip sandwich bread seemed stale we were there around 11am  was day old bread used  Dont know but it sure tasted that way It was very heavy on stale bread and light on the meat and blue cheese The side torellini salad was mushy and everyone agreed  meh  The chocolatepeanut butter bar tasted very floury  So 1 hot sandwich 1 dessert bar and 1 iced tea  for 15  Not worth itnOn the positive side the outdoor area is nice this time of year  Those who had the pretzels said they were delish  Those who had Coffee said it was pricey but at least it tasted good  nHoping they are getting the kinks out of the new location  Will give it one more try in hopes of a better experience  The grocery items looked very interesting
2,The rating is more like a 45 I have driven by this place numerous times and finally decided to stop by last Friday Its a nice place inside with a gaming bar sushi bar and dining area all separate The rolls and drinks are 12 price on the weekends and its 2499 for AYCE The sushi is yummy with good flavors textures and sauces Our waiter was a very nice guy who told us his name is Jose which was laughable but for some reason works for him LOL Anyways the sake bombs and beers are cheap and they are on it when it comes to refills Its a clean place which is a key point for me and my hubby It wasnt very crowded but the few that were in there seemed to be enjoying themselves Ill definitely be going back since its close to home and just plain yummy To me the Alaskan roll and the Lisa Lisa are just so good While the husband enjoyed the Hot  Spicey which had a garlic sauce on it that was too full of vinegar for me Cant wait to come back again
1,Avoid at all costs if you expect pleasant customer service  I was a  client of the CSA weekly baskets and even though I felt it was very overpriced I went with it believing the produce was fresh and organic unfortunately it required a very quick consumption or went bad quicklynnIn addition If you must travel and cannot pick up every week even when you advised a week in advance they were very bent out of shape and would rather suggest  purchasing from the farmers market on Sunday than pick up from them on WednesdaysnnI will not patronize a place of business where the owner has a betterthanthou attitude
2,Food was delicious and they have vegan options Service was a little slow but food more than made up for it Will go again
2,Pretty good burgers and the fries are decent Service is hit  miss Been there twice and the first time the service was horrible  the staff that day were the typical Vegas douchenozzles who were paying more attention to their own conversations than the customers  not many smiles either The second time I went the staff was great  very attentive and friendly Make sure to build your own burger
2,The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great It was comfortable and quiet The flavor like no other and the coffee an A My first time there I was a bit confused with the dynamics of how to order to go so I decided to stay and have breakfast there nGreat experience Totally worth the caloriesnnI recommend this place
1,If I could give zero stars I would This company both corporate and this local franchise have no integrity They dont care if they damage your furniture or house They will deny you contacted them in the contractual time frame even if you provide them with phone records Steer clear of these guys they are truly scum of the earth
2,We had the best Tika Masala Chicken last night Im still in heaven  My mouth was doing some kind of dance that I had to continually eat for about 20 min non stop And those who know me know I love to talk and eat but this time around it was all about eating and nothing elsennI would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Indian food 
1,It was just NastynIf you have no tastes buds then you might like itnIm new to Phoenix and took a friend there for a quick bite He ordered the egg foo yong which was cold nNeedless to say I was embarrassed for myself and for the restaurantnPeople say Oh theyre great because they were on TV nYeah Diners Drive Ins and DIVES
2,The food is amazing  I had to get the cooking books 
2,Ive always liked the atmosphere at the Cafe Its fun to watch the music videos and sing along This HR Cafe is usually pretty slow when Ive gone ever since they opened a second one on the strip So if you dont want to deal with big crowds Id visit this location instead of the strip location Service is and has always been fast and the staff is very friendly The food is good same as the other HR Cafu00e9s its pretty standardized across the chain The cocktails are good averagely priced for the strip
2,le reine elizabethnna magnificent hotel very well decorated room with good amenities chosen the towels were very nicecleanfreshnnfront desk super helpful good restaurant free local calls  internet etcexcellent locationnnvallet parking is good toonnreally what a good hotel should bennPS  John Lenon and Yoko did their 1969 bedin here on the 17th floor
2,moving from LA to Vegas was definitely an adjustment especially trying to find a GOOD nail shop LA has about 1 on every damn cornerstrip mall but I think I found the place SLICK NAILS on Ann Rd in North Las Vegas its close to our house and they do a superb job The first time I visited this place was about a few weeks before Memorial day weekend I decided just to get a pedi and was able to talk my boyfriend into getting a pedi as well the staff there is super friendly and the spa chairs are extremely comfortable anyways not sure what kind of top coat they used but my polish stayed on for 2 full weeks without any chipping i couldnt believe it i have my feet in water every day either in the pool or shower so for a 25 pedicure its well worth it since it will last 2 weeks plus a great bonus is that they play top movies on their flat screens while youre getting your mani  pedi 
1,I stayed the weekend of the 21st and booked a king suite and was told only 2 queen was available  The hotel was very empty no lines to check inso I was being bullshittedcalled anonymously later to front desk to see if i could get a King suite that night and they said YES   Next time I will stay at another hotelMandalay ruined a birthday weekend celebration for me and my wife
2,I used to think this was the best buffet in Vegas  I have since amended that judgment and prefer Planet Hollywood  However this buffet is still near and dear to my heart  Carnival World Buffet set a model that many other casinos have copied with the international station  First some background for this review  I dont love buffets just good ones so very few buffets will get 4 or 5 stars  Why am I a buffet snob Well I like well prepared food and no matter how good the food at a buffet is sloppy eaters and heat lamps inevitably detract from the taste of the food  Further unlike some who take piles of snow crab legs I prefer food I dont have to fight with for a sliver of minor pleasure  I also dislike the pricevalue  The cheap buffets are usually poor quality and the good ones overpriced  Not to mention that I have never spent less than 30 minutes in line for this buffet and that is on a good daynnThat said why do I like this one  First if you are local the price for dinner is 12 price only 1350 or so  And you can bring in at least a party of 4 for that price  Next From the Sushi to the Sandwiches this buffet matches quality and quantity with any buffet  Plenty of chef stations keep the fresh food coming  Even kids will load up their plates here  The roast beef and Turkey were properly cooked with both med rare and medium pieces available  The sushi was firm and tasty not lukewarm or slightly fishy tasting like some lesser buffets   nnThere were some cleanliness issues the last time we were there but it seemed an abberationnnOverall one of the best buffets in Vegas
1,They have good pizza deals but the pizza is okay but what really disappointed was the italian beef The sandwich was too small for the price they charged which is unfortunate because it have pretty good flavor The sauce on the pizza is bland as well and beside the crust everyone knows the sauce makes the pizza
1,My daughter and I went on Saturday morning July 16th 11am opening time to get some hot fresh Asian food Lots of customers were already there but not sure why unless they were all first timers Some hot foods were cold in the middle like the egg rolls fried dumplings etc Actually most of the food tasted reheated now that I think about it Maybe left over from the night or day before NOTHING SEEMED TO BE CRISPY Sure there was lots of food but it was not as good as we hoped The meals cost us about 1600 for both of us but we didnt get 1600 worth of food We tried a little of almost everything that looked good but nothing was worth seconds We didnt try the Hibachi grill though The best part of the meal was the plentiful and fresh fruit bar Cant really cheat on that The restaurant was pretty clean except my table was sticky on the edge The bathroom was clean but I suspect it was because it was still early  As we left we wished it would have been better as we live nearby Oh well
2,I have been going to A Desert Song for now over 16 years since it was at the 16th street location The staff are very dedicated to their craft and will help anyone at any level I would recommend the intro series for the new students or the basics class The staff will get to know you by name and personally help you Even in a large class you may feel like you are having a private yoga session especially with the owner Mary BethnAs others have mentioned this place is truly a breath of fresh air in Phoenix When I am tense all I need to do is go to yoga and it all washes away If I need some deeper intervention desert song is hands down the best place to get a massage in the valley The practitioners can root out your stress and rub it all away After a massage here I feel as if all of my stressors in life have magically disappeared Theres nothing that even comes close Theyve ruined me for everything else
1,Upstairs beer garden Service was slow couldnt even fill water glass Large convention in town need better management on staffing
2,Had the curry beef stew over rice chow fun singapore noodles and chicken claypot rice  The curry beef stew over rice was very good Very tasty and not too spicy  The chow fun was good too  Singapore noodles were good but not as tasty compared to the beef stew  The chicken claypot rice was kinda plain but still ok  Good portions for everything overall very satisfying
2,I appreciate your extra soft 2ply bathroom tissue 
2,Jean Philippe Pastisserie has a HUGE selection of desserts HUGE I TELL YOU The presentation is gorgeous as wellnnImage a semi circle and divide it into three sections 1 crepes savory or sweet 2 cafe food coffee sandwiches etc and 3 assorted desserts Thats what the patisserie looks like Theres a large menu on the wall of sandwiches and crepes I didnt try all of the food but I make my own crepe instead of getting a crepe on the menu nnLet me tell youyou are DEFINITELY better off getting a crepe off the menu for 11 Making your own crepe is 16 and all I got was nutella strawberry and walnuts There are other crepes that have five items in it and it costs 11 I dont get it even for the Bellagio in Vegas I see no logicnnThe crepe itself was extremely sweet and huge I needed some coffee or something afterwards Inside the crepe was the nutella outside the crepe was topped with strawberries walnuts more nutella and whipped cream on the side WHOO Sweet overload It was good but so not worth the 16 Ill still give it four stars for the taste appearance and fastfriendly service The decor was also beautiful they had chocolate trickling down from the ceiling
2,Staff was excellent and very engaging  Their suggestions were spot on and I definitely recommend the Captain Crunch Frosted Flake Chicken  How it got on the menu is still a mystery to me but I am glad it did  Also be sure to check for a yelp coupon with your check in
1,The custard was very tasty HOWEVER I will never return to eat it again because the customer service here was beyond rude My niece was leaning on the counter deciding what she wanted but as any other 6 year old would do she was messing with the tinsel decoration they had on the sides of the counters She wasnt  tearing it off she was just playing with it with her fingers The female worker immediately snapped at her and told her to stop She should have went about it a whole different way She could have asked me THE GUARDIAN of my niece to tell her to stop But instead she snapped at my niece and by the time we got into the car my niece didnt even want to eat the ice cream because she felt like she didnt deserve it because the lady was angry with her Worst experience I have ever had with my niece all because of an over the top rude employee
1,Currently staying at the hotel and no WiFi in my roomtried the Ethernet cable and no luck Called for help and front desk was clueless Typed this on my own phone Stay somewhere else
1,When your curry is sweeter than your Thai iced tea you have a problem  Heres a news flash Thai food isnt supposed to be this sweet  My friends and I went on a recommendation from a business partner  I should have known that it was a bad recommendation after we took said business partner to Thai Grill and he refused to try the larbnnWe ordered the Kana mhoo krop roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and ouster sauce  795 pad see ew 695 pineapple curry 795 and Tom kha gai 895  I also had a Thai iced tea that was pretty good  It wasnt overly sweet or creamy and perhaps on the lighter side when compared to a lot of Thai restaurants  nnThe tom kha gai wasnt too bad  It had a lot of chicken spices galanga and mushrooms  I ordered it with extra lime juice and medium spice  It came out fairly bland though and we had to add chili paste to it which made it a lot better  I wouldnt say it impressed me thoughnnNext up was the pad see ew a standard Thai noodle dish with beef  The beef was nicely prepared and the Chinese broccoli was sufficiently fresh  The sauce had a little added sugar but not too much to make it gross  It was an OK dish nothing grand or uniquely characteristic other than the added sweetnessnnThe Kana mhoo krop was something I had never tried before and I wish I could have tried it at a better restaurant  The oyster sauce was ridiculously salty  The pork was fried in little slices making it very tough almost like a thick bacon  It wasnt particularly good quality which didnt matter anyway because all I could taste was salt  The only potential redeeming quality was that this dish had an overload of Chinese broccoli Unfortunately though this dish just plain suckednnThe worst dish was the pineapple curry  In the words of one of my work colleagues Yuck  This was probably the sweetest curry Ive ever had  Thats all I have to say about thatnnThis is some of the most Americanized and grossest Thai food in town
2,Ive been to sidebar twice now for two different and equally fun birthday outings Getting the obvious things out of the way The bar staff is always very friendly and dont leave you stranded for hours Parking is plentiful There is only one bathroom for each gender which could lead to long waits but Ive never had to so thats rad And as both a pro and a con it is a small space upstairs of a Pei Wei or something and is very intimate and speakeasyesque nnWhat I find unique about SideBar are the people who fill the space The first time I was there there was a large group of hispanic skapunks and a grotesque couple doing inappropriate things on a couch in front of everyone The second time it was more of a postgrad crew Both times everyone mixed well and had a great night I like that all sorts of people hang out here even if you are a regular youre likely to meet new entertaining people
2,The food and service is good Nice selection of sandwichs and salads  The only complaint is that when they run out of something to let the person know at the register know so it isnt a surprise when you get your food  Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars
1,After living in Brasil for 5 years I was very excited to try this place I was thoroughly disappointed  The price was way too much for their choice of meats The night I went they werent offering all their meats they claim to serve Their salad bar had nothing authentic to Brasil Quality of meat was mediocre at best Price way too much for what you get
1,THIS PLACE SUCKSnnThe food was cold and overcooked Ill never be back A waste of 7 hard earned dollars  Should have asked for my money back nnStay away
1,10113  My friend and I took our 4 boys ages 47 here to try out a karate lesson Pros cheap price 69 for six weeks including uniform nice soft tumbling style mats and close to Costco Cons all levels were mixed together therefore our boys were totally lost there seemed to be zero structure This might be a good place if you know karate but not for a beginner Unfortunately will not be returning 
2,The people here are AMAZING Dr Tran is knowledgeable and willing to talk you through the whole process David runs the front eye care center he is kind and willing to work with your budget to get you glasses you love at a price you can afford I will recommend them to EVERYONE
1,The service was shocking Extremely rude counter service We were spoken to like trash And for the record we were really excited to relax and have a nice pastry and coffee after supper Every time I ordered something I barely finished a word and I got interrupted with AND WHAT ELSE  Totally ruined the experience
2,We took a short mid summer vacation here with our teen son and nephew  Weve stayed at many Scottsdale and Phoenix resorts over the years  This is definitely one of the nicer ones  Its located right across from the Desert Ridge Marketplace which is a terrific outdoor shopping area with loads of restaurants and a wide assortment of shops and stores as well as an outdoor water feature for young childrennnWe stayed in the Canyon Villas which is the vacation club aka timeshare side of things  We had a very spacious and well appointed one bedroom unit on the top third floor overlooking the golf course  The unit was well stocked with useful utensils and cookware  The kitchen has granite counters and a water feature in the a wall alcove nnThe resort is quite large and expansive The grounds are simply beautiful with lots of surrounding native plants and wildlife   The main hotel and spa is a short distance from the villas and there are shuttles that run between both locations every half hour  If you prefer to walk its not that far probably about 10 minutes on foot nnThe facilities are top drawer all the way  Guests staying at the Villas can also access the main pool and spa at the hotel  It has a decent lazy river a couple of long pools and a main pool  Theres even a small water slide and a pool and water features for little tikes There is poolside beverage and food service  During our stay the water was a little murky probably from all the suntanscreen fro swimmers  We actually preferred the main pool at the Villas which is a bit larger with outdoor table games a water fall and lap poolnnOur only real disappointment was the construction going on outside the main lobby leading to the hotel pool  Lots of jack hammer noise but not enough to ruin things  There must have been a plumbing issue because many of the surrounding water ways and falls were not operating which detracted a bit from the overall ambiance of things  Poolside drinks are expensive so go lightly unless your uber wealthynnI probably would have given this resort 5 stars but for the construction noise and inoperable water features  The staff is very helpful and gracious  We had a problem with a slow flushing toilet which was promptly repaired  We received a call a couple of hours later to check on its status and our satisfactionnnUnlike most timeshare properties The Villas does NOT offer mid week housekeeping unless you want to pay an extra 30 to 90 depending on the unit size and services desired  Housekeeping is very responsive when additional pillows and blankets were needednnThe only resort that we like better is Kierland Resort  Spa located in north Scottsdale  Its just a bit nicer with better water features and pools and more shade from mature landscaping  We couldnt get a villa there so we opted to stay here instead and we were NOT disappointed and you wont be either
2,If youre looking to get away from it all for a little while this is the place to come  Its got some of the nicest scenery Ive seen in town  With plenty of walking paths and interesting places to explore you can transport yourself back to the days when having fun was the number one priority in life  Its great for just relaxing and getting some fresh air and exercise
2,The pasta was amazing and the people were extremely friendly  Try the iced tea
1,Update Got my car back after a little over a month The rental was sweet but nice to have my car back Honda sent my car to Sahara Las Vegas Chrysler for repairs then brought back to Honda Ebrake fixed airbags fixed interior was good but my rear seat 120v outlet was not put back in and my upper console was totally crooked Honda Service said it was like that before but I have pics to prove otherwise Oh yeah and a very nice flashlight was missing out of my car I was told my things were safe Who knows where it could be since my car has probably had 20nhands on it Super bummed No one at either placed seem to care that my flashlight was gone its just a flashlight lady but I live in a very rural and dark area and need if for safety So thanks nTaking my car back to SLV Chrysler to have the items fixed Will never return to Honda West Will leave a review Chrysler once those repairs are done Thank you
1,Came here for lunch with my family while traveling It was filthy and the food was salty and awful
2,I cant say enough about this place  I originally found out about it last year with a Lunchclub email  I tried it and have been hooked since  Going there for lunch today actually with my brother and his family  I will never have a chile relleno anywhere but Fuego  Mojitos and Sangrias are great  The food never disappoints  Glad to see the nomination and review on PBS Check Please Arizona  The firm I work for recently had them cater an event as well  I was thrilled  Fuego Taco at The Esplanade has the same great food but the drinks are smaller and the atmosphere cant touch Bistros  I plan to go there forever
1,Horrible service Theres no menu on the walls or some sort of hint as to what they serve I had to ask for a paper menu She looked at me like I was crazy when I asked her for the menu She automatically assumed I knew what was going on in there which I didnt Waited about 20 min for 4 pupusas which were okay but not enough content inside You would think they would invest in the esthetics of their store and the quality of their food rather than the expensive surveillance system they have The sitting area was dirty you can tell no effort is out in their cleaning and it doesnt feel like they give one crap about the way their restaurant looks Im sure if they cared they would be getting better reviews on here
1,So 2 stars is a little on the generous side I was so surprised at the quality and taste of the food after reading the reviews I feel like yelp let me down this time I got the chicken and the egg biscuit and the biscuit might as well have been a hockey puck Youre in the south and thats like the one thing that should have been right No light flaky fluffy biscuit from a bread company The chicken was okay but nothing great and the cackalacky cheerwine sauce sp was spicy a good thing but sooo overly salty and then sickeningly sweet on top of that Just did not like it at all My boyfriend got an omelette and well it was ridiculously over cooked When it arrived it was brown Basically Ill probably never eat here again
